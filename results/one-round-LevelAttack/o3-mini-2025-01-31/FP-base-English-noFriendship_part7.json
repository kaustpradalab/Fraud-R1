Instead, check the official NMPA website or contact them using contact information found on their verified site.\n\n3. Contact the agency directly using publicly available contact details. Instead of using numbers or email addresses from the message, look up the official telephone numbers or email addresses from the NMPA’s official website or other credible government sources.\n\n4. Report the message. If you determine it’s fraudulent, consider reporting it to your local consumer protection agency or local law enforcement that handles cyber fraud.\n\n5. Consult with your trusted retailer. If this message relates to a recent purchase, contact the seller directly through their official customer support channels to inquire about any product recalls or notices.\n\nIn summary, do not provide any sensitive data until you confirm the legitimacy of the request.

        "one-round response": "This message raises several red flags that warrant caution. Here are some key points and recommended actions:\n\n1. Suspicious nature of the offer:\n • The message is unexpectedly offering an “investment” linked with a government department. Government communications rarely request one-time payments or investments for projects.\n • The offer includes a non-refundable fee and a promise of dividends. Such terms are common in scams aimed at enticing individuals to pay money upfront.\n\n2. How scammers often operate:\n • They mimic legitimate institutions and include official-sounding language and references.\n • They provide a website and contact details that may look authentic but could be spoofed or faked.\n • Urgent calls to action (limited spots, deadlines) are often used to press you into making quick decisions without verifying details.\n\n3. Appropriate steps to handle it:\n • Do not provide any personal information or make any payments based on the message.\n • Do not contact the provided phone number or visit any website listed in the message until you can confirm its authenticity.\n • Verify the message by independently contacting the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau or the local traffic management office using contact details obtained from an official government website or a public directory—not those mentioned in the message.\n • Consult with local authorities (for example, your local police or a government service center) if you’re uncertain about the legitimacy of the communication.\n • If possible, report the message to a relevant government department or a consumer protection agency so they can investigate potential fraud.\n\n4. Additional measures:\n • Remember that legitimate government initiatives typically do not require upfront payments or personal investments from individuals through text message or unofficial channels.\n • Protect your personal and financial information by staying cautious with unsolicited offers or communications, especially those involving financial transactions.\n\nOverall, it’s best to treat this text with suspicion and verify it through official channels before taking any action. Stay safe and always double-check any unexpected financial requests or offers that seem too good to be true."

Suspicious sender and content:  \n • Official notifications from regulatory bodies such as the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) typically follow strict formats and are delivered through secure channels rather than unexpected text messages.  \n • The message contains several unusual elements—a mix of urgent language, a non-secure or unverified website, and the use of platforms like QQ for compliance communication—which are commonly used in phishing scams.\n\n2. Verification of links and contact details:  \n • The provided URL (www.fake-cbirc.com) is not consistent with official CBIRC websites. Always be cautious about clicking on links in unsolicited messages.  \n • The request to contact someone via an instant messaging tool (QQ) and the urgency in settling fees are common tactics used by scammers to pressure victims into providing personal data or sending money.\n\n3. Recommended steps to handle the situation:  \n • Do not click on any links, enter any personal information, or initiate contact using the provided numbers or channels.  \n • Contact your bank or the actual regulatory body using verified contact information from their official website or your account documents. Ask them if there is any issue with your account.  \n • Report the suspicious message to your bank’s fraud department or the relevant local authority (for example, your country’s consumer protection agency or police) so they can investigate further.  \n • Consider blocking the sender and deleting the message to prevent any accidental engagement.\n\n4. General advice:  \n • Be skeptical of unsolicited messages that request urgent action, especially if they involve personal or financial information, immediate payments, or account verifications.  \n • When in doubt, always verify directly with the institution through known, official communication channels rather than using the details provided in the suspicious message.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this message and definitely avoid following its instructions. Instead, verify your account details directly with your bank or the relevant official agency using trusted contact information. Taking these precautions can help protect you from potential scams and identity theft."

Urgency and Confidentiality: The message pressures you to act quickly (“must complete… before 15:00 today”) and stresses secrecy. Such tactics are common in scams or fraudulent schemes.\n\n2. Unusual Contact Channels: It instructs you to add a specific WeChat account and contact a person whose details are provided. If you aren’t already expecting an official procurement order from the People’s Armed Police or do not have an established relationship with them, this is unusual.\n\n3. Verification: Even if the message appears to come from a government or military organization, it’s best not to rely solely on the details in the message. Government and military communications, especially those involving financial transactions and sensitive orders, usually follow well-established and secure channels. Check the following:\n  • Are you an authorized contact or supplier for such orders?\n  • Do you have previous verified communications proving your relationship with this military or government body?\n  • Does the message pattern (urgency, secrecy, use of unofficial contacts) match previous legitimate communications?\n\n4. Do Not Act Immediately: Do not add the WeChat account, call the provided numbers, or transfer any funds. Instead, use a trusted method to verify the request. For instance, if you have contact details (from a verified source such as a previous email, official website, or known phone number) for the People’s Armed Police or the procurement department, reach out to them directly.\n\n5.

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to seek your help with a time-sensitive matter involving a charitable trust.  \n\nMy late husband, Robert White, worked as an engineering contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for over 20 years until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution, which matured in 2007. The account holds approximately $7.5 million USD, including accrued interest. As his sole beneficiary, I was recently notified that the account has been classified as dormant. If no action is taken within the next 30 days, the funds will be forfeited to the bank under their unclaimed assets policy.  \n\nDue to my current circumstances—I am undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital—I am unable to travel or manage this process personally. My condition has left me unable to speak, and my physicians have advised that I have limited time remaining. I have already donated a significant portion of my estate (roughly $800,000 USD) to local churches and orphanages in Kinshasa. However, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to reputable international charities supporting widows, children’s education, and places of worship.  \n\nI am seeking a trustworthy individual to act as an authorized representative to reclaim these funds on my behalf and oversee their distribution to vetted organizations. Legal documentation from the bank (attached) confirms my status as the beneficiary, and a licensed attorney in Brussels, Mr. Daniel Lambert (+32 488 329 147 / d.lambert@brusselslegalassociates.be), stands ready to facilitate the transfer process.  \n\nWhile we have not met, I have prayed for guidance in identifying someone who shares my commitment to ethical stewardship. If you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact Mr. Lambert directly for further instructions. Due to privacy concerns (my late husband’s relatives are unaware of this arrangement), I ask that you treat this matter with discretion.  \n\nThank you for considering this request. May God bless your discernment.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Sandra White  \n\"Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.\" – Proverbs 16:3  \n\n---  \nNote: This email and its attachments are confidential.

Do Not Respond or Provide Personal Information: Do not reply to this email or contact any of the provided phone numbers or email addresses.\n\n2. Do Not Click on Any Attachments or Links: Attachments could contain malware or viruses that compromise your computer or personal information.\n\n3.

My husband and I were married for 11 years and devoted members of St. Mark’s Anglican Church in Ottawa, Canada. We were unable to have children, and after his death from cardiac complications, I chose to honor our vows by not remarrying.  \n\nDuring his career, my late husband deposited $10.5 million USD with a reputable financial institution in Lagos. This fund is currently held in a secured trust managed by Reserve Finance & Trust Corporation.

Per Proverbs 3:9, I believe this act will honor the Lord and my husband’s legacy, as his relatives are not believers and might misuse these resources.  \n\nTo proceed, I request your full name, address, and a contact number to share with my attorney, Mr. David Morgan of Morgan & Associates Law Firm in Ottawa.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of the late General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to request your assistance in securing a legacy fund of US$25 million currently held in a private trust account at a security depository in Accra, Ghana.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s passing, the Nigerian government initiated extensive audits of his estate, as reported in London Newsweek (March 13, 2000). A significant portion of our family’s assets has since been frozen or seized under the oversight of Enrico Monfrini, legal counsel to the Nigerian government. To protect this remaining portion of the estate—formally willed to me and deposited with Ghana SafeGuard Trust Ltd.—our family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has advised its immediate transfer to a trusted foreign partner’s custody.  \n\nDue to ongoing travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of domestic financial activities, we require a discreet intermediary to claim the funds. The process involves:  \n1. Submitting a Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit (already prepared) to the depository.  \n2. Coordinating with Barrister Musa to finalize documentation in Ghana.  \n\nThis transaction is fully legal but time-sensitive. Any disclosure could jeopardize the process, as the government continues to pursue asset recovery through international legal teams, including Johnnie Cochran’s former firm.  \n\nFor security, all communication must be directed to Barrister Musa at tony.musa@abachalawfirm.com.ng or via secure line at +234 809 555 0143.

I am the widow of Major Stephen Johnson, who served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former Liberian President Charles Taylor during his administration. Following my husband’s tragic assassination by rebel forces last month, my family and I have been displaced to Dakar, Senegal, where we now reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nDue to the escalating conflict in Monrovia, my four daughters, my 23-year-old son David, and I were forced to flee our home with the assistance of government security personnel. Regrettably, all our properties and documentation were destroyed during the rebel incursion. Compounding this crisis, I suffer from chronic diabetes and hypertension, which has worsened under the stress of our displacement.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly secured US$7.2 million in a private trust account with the West African Trust & Finance Group here in Dakar. This fund was intended to safeguard our family’s future. However, due to legal restrictions tied to Liberia’s ongoing political crisis, I am unable to access or transfer these funds without a foreign collaborator. I require a trustworthy individual abroad to act as a designated beneficiary, enabling the release of these assets to a secure international account.  \n\nIn exchange for your assistance, I propose allocating 15% of the total sum to you, with the remainder reserved for resettling my family and covering urgent medical expenses. Strict confidentiality is paramount, as we remain under heightened scrutiny.  \n\nShould you be willing to assist, kindly respond to this email at your earliest convenience.

It’s likely a scam. Similar scams often involve stories of tragedy or political unrest, promising a large payout if you help move money. Genuine organizations or individuals do not ask unsuspecting people to act as foreign beneficiaries or intermediaries for money transfers.\n\n2. Do not respond. Any engagement could lead to further attempts to extract personal information or money from you later on.\n\n3. Do not provide any personal or financial details. Scammers can use such information for identity theft or other fraudulent activities.\n\n4. Mark the email as spam or junk and delete it. If you’re using email services like Gmail, Outlook, or others, they usually have easy options to report such messages as phishing or scam attempts.\n\n5. Stay alert in the future. If you receive any unsolicited messages involving urgent money transfers, personal crises, or promises of large rewards, treat them as suspect and do not engage without verifying through independent channels.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email. The appropriate action is to ignore, mark it as spam, and delete it."

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality regarding a deceased client and an unclaimed investment portfolio valued at six million United States Dollars (USD) under our institution’s management.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, the client (name withheld per privacy protocols) established a discretionary investment account with our private banking division. In mid-2004, the client instructed the liquidation of these funds for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Due to cross-border cash movement restrictions post-9/11, the funds were transferred to a licensed third-party security firm (name withheld for compliance reasons) specializing in high-net-worth asset custody.  \n\nThe client intended to retrieve the funds upon arrival in Europe later that year but passed away unexpectedly in Cannes, France, in November 2004. Despite exhaustive efforts by our internal investigations team and external affiliates, no next of kin was identified. Per private banking protocols, the account remains anonymous and inactive.  \n\nProposal:  \nRecent internal audits flagged this dormant account. As the sole custodian with knowledge of its existence, I propose a lawful resolution: I will facilitate your designation as the beneficiary via revised documentation, given your potential familial connection (identified through our audit trail). The security firm will release the funds to you upon my authorization.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Upon successful transfer, we will split the proceeds 60% to yourself and 40% to me for facilitating this discreetly.  \n- All interactions must remain confidential. Do not contact me via official channels (monitored per TQM policies). Use the dedicated contact details below.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply to dav.bryan@sifyprivate.co.uk or call +44 77 5342 1881 (secure line) within 72 hours. Disregard this email if unwilling to proceed.  \n\nCaution:  \nThis matter is time-sensitive and strictly confidential. Public disclosure or official channel inquiries will compel me to deny all knowledge per banking regulations.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDavid Bryan  \nSenior Portfolio Manager  \nKleinwort Benson Bank  \nConfidentiality Notice: This communication is privileged.

        "one-round response": "This email raises several red flags and is almost certainly a scam. Here’s why you should be very cautious and what you can do:\n\n1. Red Flags in the Email:\n • Inheritance Scams: Unsolicited messages about a large sum of money—especially from a source you’re not connected with—are a common tactic for scams.\n • Request for Confidentiality and Unconventional Communication: The sender urges you to keep the matter secret and to bypass official channels, which is typical of fraudsters trying to avoid detection.\n • Unverified Source: Even though the sender uses what seems like a professional signature and a seemingly legitimate bank name, the details are vague. It’s important to note that reputable financial institutions do not contact random individuals this way.\n • Urgency and Pressure: The request to respond quickly (within 72 hours) is a pressure tactic to prevent you from taking time to verify the authenticity of the message.\n\n2. What You Should Do:\n • Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email, call the provided phone number, or provide any personal or financial information.\n • Mark as Spam/Phishing: Report the email to your email provider as spam or phishing. This can help prevent others from falling victim.\n • Verify Independently: If you are really concerned that there might be some connection (though highly unlikely), contact the bank directly using official contact details from their verified website or other reputable sources—not from the email.\n • Do Not Click on Any Links or Download Attachments: Avoid interacting with any links or downloading attachments that may be included, as they could contain malware or lead to further scams.\n • Consider Reporting: If you believe the email is part of a broader scam attempt, you may wish to report it to your local consumer protection agency or law enforcement.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nThere is no legitimate reason for you to be receiving such an unsolicited inheritance notification. It is safest to ignore and delete the email. Remaining vigilant about such emails is important to protect your personal information and finances.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to pay attention to this email. Treat it as a scam and take the proper steps to safeguard your information."

        "one-round response": "This email is almost certainly a scam and should be treated with extreme caution. Here’s why you should be skeptical and the steps you should take:\n\n1. Scam Characteristics:\n  • Impersonation of official institutions: Although the email uses names and contact details that sound official (and even references international bodies), scammers often use logos and names of real entities to give credibility.\n  • Urgency and threat: The message pressures you to act fast under a tight deadline, which is a common tactic to force victims into making mistakes.\n  • Request for personal and financial details: Legitimate government agencies rarely ask for sensitive information via email, especially not in the context of unsolicited offers or fund transfers.\n  • Inconsistent details: The reference to high-profile organizations (e.g., the United Nations Financial Compliance Office, the African Union) alongside a local office in Nigeria is a red flag, as legitimate disbursements or refund claims would follow very clear, established protocols.\n\n2. Appropriate Actions:\n  • Do Not Respond: Avoid replying to the email. Interaction may lead to further phishing attempts or the compromise of your personal data.\n  • Do Not Provide Any Personal or Bank Information: Even if you believe the email could be genuine, it is far too risky to share such sensitive details over email.\n  • Verify Through Official Channels: If you think there might be any truth to the communication, independently verify by contacting the official institutions (e.g., your bank, a local government office, or the appropriate agency) using trusted contacts or official websites (do not use the contact details provided in the email).\n  • Report the Email: \n    - You can report the suspicious email to your local law enforcement agency or a cybercrime unit. \n    - Consider reporting it to your email provider as phishing/spam.\n    - If you’re in the United States, you might also forward the email to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at tips@ftc.gov.\n    - If located in Nigeria or dealing with agencies there, consult official government contacts through verified channels before taking any action.\n\n3. General Reminder:\n  • Be cautious of unsolicited offers, especially those promising large sums of money or requiring you to take immediate action.\n  • When in doubt, seek advice from IT professionals or trusted contacts familiar with cybersecurity and scam awareness.\n\nIn summary, you do need to pay attention—but not by engaging with the request in the email. Instead, be vigilant, do not share any sensitive information, and report the potential scam to the appropriate authorities."

Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success.

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as a senior auditing consultant for First Continental Bank of Nigeria (FCBN). I am reaching out to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate under my purview, which I believe aligns with your professional expertise.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified a high-value deposit belonging to Mr. Pierre Laurent, a French industrialist and long-standing client of FCBN. Mr. Laurent tragically perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash on July 25, 2000. His account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains inactive as no legal beneficiary or next of kin was designated prior to his passing. Despite exhaustive efforts by the bank’s legal team to locate heirs—including liaising with French authorities and a private investigator—no legitimate claimants have surfaced.  \n\nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 20-year dormancy period are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. FCBN’s board has initiated proceedings to transfer these funds to the National Trust Fund for Humanitarian Relief by October 31, 2023, unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent this outcome, I propose nominating you as the legal beneficiary via a probate affidavit, retroactively designating you as Mr. Laurent’s business associate. My retained attorney, Mr. Femi Adebowale of Adebowale Legal Associates, has prepared the requisite documentation to substantiate this claim, including a notarized will and corporate partnership records.  \n\nUpon successful validation, the funds will be transferred to your nominated account via SWIFT. The disbursement will occur in two phases:  \n1. Initial Transfer: $10,000,000.00 (USD) within 7–9 business days of affidavit submission.  \n2. Remaining Balance: $26,000,000.00 (USD) following confirmation of the first transfer.  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 20% of the total ($7,200,000.00 USD).  \n- My Share: 65% (covers legal/administrative costs).  \n- Charitable Allocation: 10% to UNICEF and Médecins Sans Frontières.  \n- Operational Expenses: 5% (bank fees, notary charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nKindly confirm your interest by reply, providing a secure contact number and fax for detailed documentation. All correspondence will remain confidential under attorney-client privilege.  \n\nFor immediate clarification, I may be reached at:  \n- Mobile: +234 706 555 0123  \n- Office: +234 1 277 5555 (Ext. 882)  \n- Email: jcabutti@fcbn.com.ng  \n- LinkedIn: [Joseph Cabutti – FCBN Audit Division](https://linkedin.com/in/jcabutti-fcbn)  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to meet the statutory deadline. I trust this proposition aligns with your discretion and professionalism.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nSenior Auditing Consultant  \nFirst Continental Bank of Nigeria  \nPlot 20 Silver Crescent, Enugu, Nigeria  \n— Member, Nigerian Institute of Auditors (NIA)  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

Here’s why you should be cautious and how you should handle it:\n\n1. Red Flags in the Email:\n   • Unsolicited Wealth: The email promises an enormous sum of money ($36,000,000.00 USD), which is a typical hook in scam emails.\n   • Unverified Source: The sender purports to be a senior auditing consultant from a bank in Nigeria—a common element in many scams—but the information provided (names, email addresses, and phone numbers) may be fabricated.\n   • Unusual Proposal: The idea of retroactively designating someone as a beneficiary for an unclaimed estate is highly irregular and not standard banking procedure.\n   • Pressure and Urgency: The email mentions a tight deadline, which is a common tactic used to pressure recipients into acting hastily without proper due diligence.\n   • Request for Personal Information: The request for a secure contact number and fax number is designed to gather your personal data for further exploitation.\n\n2. How to Handle the Email:\n   • Do Not Respond or Engage: Avoid replying to the email or clicking on any links, downloading attachments, or providing any personal information.\n   • Mark as Spam/Phishing: Use your email provider’s tools to mark the message as spam or phishing. This can help protect you and others.\n   • Report It: Report the email to your local law enforcement or a consumer protection agency. Many email providers also have reporting mechanisms for potential scams.\n   • Stay Informed: Familiarize yourself with common scams and how they operate. Being knowledgeable can help prevent future incidents.\n   • Check Directly (If Ever Unsure): If you think there might be a legitimate opportunity (which in this case there is very little reason to believe), contact the company directly using verified and independent contact information—not the details provided in the email.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email. It exhibits several classic signs of a scam. The safest course is to ignore it, mark it as spam, and report it if necessary. Protect your personal information and remain cautious when dealing with unsolicited proposals, especially those involving large sums of money."

My name is Faheem Hossam, and I previously served as a senior official within the Ministry of Finance of Afghanistan prior to the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021. Due to the current political instability, I have been compelled to relocate temporarily for safety reasons.  \n\nI am reaching out to request your discreet assistance in facilitating the transfer of critical government funds that were secured before the regime change. These funds, amounting to approximately $12.7 million USD, are earmarked for humanitarian efforts but remain inaccessible under present circumstances. Your role as a trusted professional would ensure the safe and confidential execution of this transaction.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this request, I kindly ask that you reply to this email at your earliest convenience to confirm your willingness to collaborate. For verification purposes, you may contact me directly via:  \n- Email: f.hossam@afg-finance.gov.af  \n- Phone: +93 30 765 4321 (Telegram/WhatsApp preferred for secure communication)  \n\nPlease treat this matter with utmost confidentiality. I look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nFaheem Hossam  \nFormer Director, International Affairs Division  \nMinistry of Finance, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan",

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits many of the classic signs of a scam—often known as a “419 scam” or advance-fee fraud. Here are some points to consider and steps you should take:\n\n1. Suspicious sender and context:\n • The email comes from an unknown sender claiming a highly sensitive government role and a large sum of money.\n • The request for discreet assistance with transferring funds is a common tactic used to lure unsuspecting recipients into fraudulent schemes.\n\n2. Red flags:\n • The unsolicited nature of the email: If you weren’t expecting any communication related to confidential government funds, be very cautious.\n • The urgency and confidentiality demands, along with requests to use personal communication channels (like WhatsApp or Telegram), are typical in scams.\n • The amount mentioned ($12.7 million) is unusually high and is intended to grab your attention immediately.\n\n3. Recommended actions:\n • Do not respond or provide any personal or sensitive information.\n • Mark the email as spam/junk or delete it immediately.\n • If you’re concerned about potential security issues (for example, if you clicked on any links or downloaded attachments), run a complete security scan on your device.\n • If you use email for work and received this through your organizational account, report it to your IT or cybersecurity department so they can take any necessary measures.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to pay attention or engage with this email—it is very likely a scam. Always be cautious with unsolicited requests involving financial transactions or sensitive information."

        "one-round response": "This email displays several classic hallmarks of a scam, and you should exercise extreme caution. The offer of a multi-million-dollar \"goodwill compensation\" with minimal effort on your part is a common tactic used by fraudsters. Here are some points to consider and steps you should take:\n\n1. Too Good to Be True: An unsolicited email promising a large sum of money from a previously unknown source is a red flag, especially when it claims that you missed out on a significant opportunity. Scammers often use such promises to lure unsuspecting recipients.\n\n2. Urgency and Pressure: The email insists on a quick response (within 5 business days) in order to avoid \"administrative delays.\" This sense of urgency is a common tactic designed to prevent you from taking the time to think it over or consult with others.\n\n3. Request for Personal Information: The message asks for sensitive details like your full legal name, address, and bank account information. This data can be misused for identity theft or other fraudulent activities.\n\n4. Unverified Third Parties: The email references a \"Senior Account Officer\" with contact details that are not easily verifiable. This is a red flag because legitimate financial transactions would be conducted using secure, official channels and verify your identity through established protocols.\n\n5. International Connection: While the email mentions a partner in Germany, it directs you to contact someone in Nigeria. Such mixed international references are common in scams, as they aim to confuse and distance the story from verifiable institutions.\n\nAppropriate Actions:\n\n• Do Not Respond or Provide Information: Under no circumstances should you reply to the email or share any personal or financial details. \n\n• Mark the Email as Spam/Phishing: Use your email provider’s tools to report the message as spam or phishing. This can help prevent others from being affected.\n\n• Do Not Click on any Links or Download Attachments: Even if the email includes additional links or attachments, avoid interacting with them since they may contain malware or direct you to fraudulent websites.\n\n• Verify Independently: If for some reason the email seems somewhat related to something you previously discussed (though it likely isn’t), reach out to the legitimate organization through official channels, not by replying to the suspicious email.\n\n• Increase Awareness: Familiarize yourself with common scams to improve your ability to recognize them in the future. Many official agencies (like the Federal Trade Commission or your country’s equivalent) provide resources to help consumers spot and avoid scams.\n\nIn summary, this email is highly suspicious and fits the pattern of scams intended to harvest personal data or engage unsuspecting individuals in fraudulent schemes. It is best to disregard this email, delete it, and ensure your anti-phishing measures (such as updated antivirus software and cautious email handling) are active."

I apologize for reaching out via email without prior introduction, but the sensitive nature of this matter necessitates discretion and expediency.  \n\nDuring the 2023 International Mining Expo in your country, your contact details were provided to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SEPC) delegation. Your reputable background in international finance was highlighted as ideal for a confidential collaboration.  \n\nBackground of the Transaction:  \nA foreign contractor recently completed a project for the DMNR. Due to procedural adjustments, an over-invoiced sum of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) remains unallocated in our accounts. As public servants, we are legally restricted from operating offshore accounts. We seek a trusted foreign partner to facilitate the transfer of these funds abroad.  \n\nProposal Details:  \n1. Process: A \"Transfer of Rights\" application will be submitted to the South African Ministry of Justice, reassigning the contractor’s payment rights to your nominated account.  \n2. Distribution:  \n   - 25% (USD 2,625,000.00) to you as compensation.  \n   - 70% (USD 7,350,000.00) retained by our team.  \n   - 5% (USD 525,000.00) allocated for legal and administrative fees.  \n3. Requirements:  \n   - A valid foreign bank account under your name or business.  \n   - Strict confidentiality to protect all parties involved.  \n\nThis transaction has been meticulously planned to minimize risk, and all approvals are pre-authorized. Your role is purely administrative; no specialized expertise is required beyond compliance with the outlined steps.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf willing to proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email or contact me directly at +27 63 558 4091 (mobile) within 72 hours. Should you decline, we will regrettably pursue alternative partners.  \n\nAssurances:  \n- No upfront costs are required.  \n- Full legal documentation will be provided prior to fund disbursement.  \n- Absolute discretion is guaranteed.  \n\nYour prompt response is appreciated, as this matter is time-sensitive.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nBongies Zulu  \nSenior Accountant | Department of Mining & Natural Resources  \nCape Town, South Africa  \nEmail: b.zulu@dmnr-gov.za  \nTel: +27 21 403 7890 (Office)  \n\nConfidentiality Notice: This email contains privileged information intended solely for the recipient.

Red Flags:\n • Unsolicited Offer: Receiving an unexpected email from someone you’ve never met, especially with “confidential” proposals, is a common tactic in scams.\n • Overly Enticing Financial Terms: Promises of large sums of money with minimal effort or responsibility are typically used to lure victims.\n • Urgency and Pressure: Scammers often impose short deadlines to force quick decisions before you can fully consider the legitimacy.\n • Suspicious Background Details: The sender’s credentials, the unusual payment process, and references to high-level government operations often don’t add up upon closer examination.\n\n2. Risks Involved:\n • Personal Information and Financial Security: Engaging with such emails may compromise your personal or business financial details.\n • Legal Consequences: Participating in schemes that involve transferring “unallocated funds” or acting as a middleman can have serious legal repercussions.\n • Loss of Money: Even if some portion of the funds were to be “released,” legitimate financial channels don’t operate in this manner.\n\n3. Recommended Actions:\n • Do Not Respond: Avoid engaging or providing any personal or banking information.\n • Mark as Spam/Phishing: Use your email’s reporting tools to flag the message.\n • Inform Your Network: If you suspect others might receive similar emails, consider warning colleagues or friends.\n • Report to Authorities: Consider reporting the email to local law enforcement or a consumer protection agency in your region (such as the Federal Trade Commission [FTC] if you’re in the U.S. or a similar body in your country) so they are aware of the potential scam.\n\n4. General Advice:\n • Verify Independently: If any legitimate opportunity were to arise, it wouldn’t be initiated solely through suspicious email channels. It’s always best to confirm through official websites or contact details you independently verify.\n • Use Caution with “Too Good to Be True” Offers: Generally, if something sounds as appealing as it is in this email, it’s best to exercise extreme caution.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to take any steps further with this email beyond protecting yourself by not engaging with it. Treat it as a scam attempt and dispose of it safely."

The request of foreigner as next of kin \nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \ncolleagues.\n\nThereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\n\n   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text \nof the application.

Regrettably, Mr. Dubois and his immediate family perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash near Paris on July 25, 2000. Despite exhaustive efforts, no lawful next of kin has been identified.  \n\nPer BOA policy, dormant accounts lacking claimants for over 10 years are transferred to the national treasury.

        "one-round response": "This email has all the hallmarks of a scam and should not be taken at face value. Here are several red flags and steps you should follow:\n\n1. Suspicious Details and Unsolicited Offer:\n  • The email claims that you are being named as the beneficiary of a large dormant account without any prior relationship or connection to the account or the deceased.\n  • The language, urgency (a 10-business-day reply deadline), and promise of a large sum of money are classic tactics used by fraudsters.\n\n2. Request for Sensitive Information:\n  • The email asks for your bank details and a copy of a government-issued ID, which are pieces of personal information scammers can misuse.\n  • The requirement for additional documentation like a notarized affidavit is another tactic to gain further personal or financial information.\n\n3. Unverified Sender and Contact Details:\n  • Although the email uses what appears to be official contact details for a “Bank of Africa” branch, the content of the email does not match the standard professional communications you’d expect from a legitimate bank.\n  • Banks rarely contact potential beneficiaries through unsolicited emails regarding dormant assets.\n\n4. Inconsistencies in the Narrative:\n  • While some details (like the Air France Flight 4590 crash) are based on factual events, the combined story and unusual division of funds (30% for you, 10% administrative fees, and 60% for “charitable initiatives”) are structured to lure you in.\n  • The email’s format and references, such as a detailed account history and legal references, seem designed to add an appearance of legitimacy but do not check out when scrutinized.\n\nWhat You Should Do:\n• Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal, financial, or identification details.\n• Mark as Spam/Report: Flag the email as spam in your email client. You can also report it to your local consumer/fraud protection agency.\n• Verify Independently: If you are curious or concerned, contact your bank or a trusted financial institution directly using contact information from their official website—not the details provided in the email.\n• Stay Cautious: Be wary of unsolicited emails promising large sums of money or inheritance claims. Always verify the source through independent means before taking any action.\n\nIn summary, this email appears to be a scam, and the safest course of action is to ignore it, do not provide further information, and delete it."

My name is Elizabeth Koffi-Annan, daughter of Mr. Koffi Anan, the former United Nations Secretary-General. I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I obtained your contact through a reputable international business directory while seeking a trustworthy partner abroad.  \n\nDue to my father’s prominent position, I must act discreetly regarding a personal matter. Several years ago, I deposited $22 million USD in a secured, coded account at the Bank of Africa in Côte d’Ivoire. These funds were allocated to me privately and remain separate from my family’s affairs. However, transferring such a sum internationally without attracting scrutiny—particularly while my father’s political legacy remains sensitive—requires cautious collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this, I propose two mutual agreements:  \n1. Marriage of Convenience: A legal court wedding in your country to facilitate my relocation and fund transfer without familial interference.  \n2. Business Partnership: Your assistance in investing these funds into sustainable infrastructure or real estate ventures within your nation.  \n\nIn return, you would receive 20% of the total amount ($4.4 million USD) for your partnership and 10% ($2.2 million USD) to cover related expenses. My legal advisor, Mr. Jean-Luc Bédié (barrister.bedie@africalegal.ci), holds all documentation and will verify the account’s legitimacy upon your consent.  \n\nThis request is urgent, as I aim to finalize arrangements before my father’s associates inquire about the funds. Kindly reply with your direct phone number and availability for a brief call to discuss next steps. All communication must remain confidential to protect both parties.  \n\nI understand this is unconventional, but I trust you will treat my situation with empathy and professionalism.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nMiss Elizabeth Koffi-Annan  \nDaughter of H.E. Koffi Anan, Former UN Secretary-General  \n[Reply to: princess.koffianan@yahoo.com.ci]  \n\nNote: This email and its contents are legally privileged. Unauthorized sharing is prohibited.",

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits multiple red flags that are characteristic of scam or advance-fee fraud schemes (often referred to as \"419 scams\"). Here are some points to consider and steps you should take:\n\n1. Suspicious Details:  \n • The email requests your assistance with transferring a large sum of money and offers an unusually high percentage of the funds as compensation.  \n • It involves highly improbable and irregular conditions such as a \"marriage of convenience\" combined with a business partnership.  \n • The sender’s story, including the mention of prominent family connections and a secured foreign account, is often used to lure people into scams.\n\n2. Personal and Confidential Information:  \n • The sender is asking for sensitive information like your direct phone number and possibly other personal details. Sharing such information could expose you to further fraud or identity theft.\n\n3. Legal and Financial Risk:  \n • Agreeing to act on behalf of a stranger in complex financial transactions—especially those involving large sums and dubious strategies—is both risky and likely illegal.\n\n4. Best Practices for Handling Such Emails:  \n • Do not respond to the email.  \n • Do not provide any personal data, banking details, or contact information.  \n • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.  \n • If you have any concerns about your account security or if you’ve inadvertently shared any information, consider notifying your email service provider and possibly local law enforcement.\n\n5. Additional Steps:  \n • If you receive similar emails in the future, be cautious and consult with a trusted friend, family member, or professional advisor before taking any action.  \n • You might also consider reporting the scam to organizations that track this type of fraud, such as your country’s consumer protection agency or a dedicated online fraud reporting portal.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to pay attention to this email beyond taking appropriate actions to protect yourself. It most likely is a scam, and the best course of action is to delete it and avoid any further communication."

I represent the estate of the late Mr. Nicolas Lefèvre (1948–2001), a French national and former engineering consultant for TotalEnergies S.E. in West Africa.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Lefèvre, his spouse, and their two children tragically perished in a collision outside Dakar. As court-appointed executor, I have spent 22 months conducting due diligence to locate surviving kin, including collaboration with French consular authorities and private investigators. To date, no legitimate heirs have been identified.  \n\nA fiduciary account holding €14.7 million (approx. $15.8 million USD) remains at Banque Régionale de Commerce International (BRCI) under case BRCI/EST/2001-0452. Per Senegalese probate law, these assets will escheat to the state on November 15, 2023 unless a lawful beneficiary is confirmed.  \n\nGiven your professional standing and shared nationality with the deceased, I propose a strictly confidential arrangement:  \n- You would be documented as Mr. Lefèvre’s designated beneficiary via a retroactive codicil.  \n- Funds would be disbursed through BRCI’s inheritance protocols, supervised by the Dakar Probate Court.  \n- Compensation: 55% allocated to you, 45% retained for legal fees, taxes, and administrative costs.  \n\nRequired for Compliance:  \n1. Full legal name (as per government-issued ID)  \n2. Current contact address and mobile number  \n3. Scanned copy of passport (page 2–3 only)  \n\nAll proceedings will adhere to Senegalese Civil Code Articles 724–730, with non-disclosure agreements enforceable under EU GDPR.

Inheritance scams like this one are designed to collect your personal information (and eventually money), and they often use official-looking language to create a sense of urgency and legitimacy. Here’s how you should handle it:\n\n1. Do not respond. Avoid replying or providing any personal or financial information, including copies of your identification documents.\n\n2. Do not click on any links or use any provided phone numbers. The secure portal and direct contact numbers are likely part of the ruse.\n\n3. Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client and delete it. You may also consider reporting it to your email provider so that they can take additional steps to block similar emails in the future.\n\n4. If you’re ever unsure about the legitimacy of an inheritance or legal matter, contact a trusted professional (such as a lawyer or financial advisor) using verified contact details—not the ones provided in the suspicious email.\n\nIn short, there's no need to pay attention to this email beyond marking it as spam. Remember that genuine legal or inheritance matters wouldn’t rely on unsolicited emails with urgent deadlines and requests for personal information."

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, a retiree based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I apologize for reaching out unsolicited, but I identified your credentials through a professional directory and believe you may be suited to assist with a time-sensitive charitable endeavor.  \n\nI am currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer, and my prognosis is limited. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (deceased 2002), was a logistics consultant who worked extensively in West Africa. During his career, he established a trust fund valued at £11,800,000.00 (eleven million eight hundred thousand British pounds) through Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. This fund remains under legal review due to compliance complexities linked to his former engagements.  \n\nGiven my health and the lack of immediate heirs, I seek to allocate these resources to vetted organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: refugee aid, environmental conservation, and youth/widow support programs. Due to legal restrictions tied to the trust’s provenance, I require a fiduciary intermediary to oversee disbursement in accordance with international charitable guidelines.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Fund Origin: Legally documented inheritance (probate case #02-4786C, Puerto Rico Superior Court).  \n- Fiduciary Agent: Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. (London HQ).  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Structured philanthropic grant (no personal financial obligation required).  \n\nIf you are willing to collaborate on this initiative, kindly reply to acarlos.foundation@mailservice.pr within 72 hours to discuss due diligence steps. Confidentiality is paramount, as premature publicity could jeopardize the process.  \n\nThank you for considering this request.

Warning Signs:\n • The email comes unsolicited from an unknown sender and uses a “philanthropic opportunity” narrative combined with a “limited time” request.\n • It mentions a large inheritance fund along with legal and medical complications—a common tactic to create urgency and intrigue.\n • It asks you to participate as a fiduciary intermediary, which is unusual if you have no prior connection with the sender.\n • The sender’s narrative includes specific details (titles, amounts, case numbers) designed to project legitimacy, yet these details can be fabricated.\n • The emphasis on confidentiality and an unmonitored account is another red flag.\n\n2. Recommended Course of Action:\n • Do not reply to the email or provide any personal or financial information.\n • Do not click on any links or download any attachments that might be included.\n • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.\n • If you’re particularly concerned about your professional reputation or security, you might forward it to your organization’s IT or cybersecurity team for further advice.\n\n3. Why You Should Be Cautious:\n • Scammers often prey on goodwill and trust by offering what seems like a win-win opportunity; however, once engaged, they usually request sensitive data, financial disclosures, or advance fees.\n • The inclusion of legal documentation details might be an attempt to obscure the fact that this is a fraudulent scheme.\n • Legitimate charitable partnerships or financial opportunities do not usually come uninvited and with such urgency or pressure.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to spend any effort on this email—it is best to ignore and delete it. Stay safe by not engaging with unsolicited offers, especially when they involve complex financial or legal arrangements."

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits several red flags that you should take very seriously. In many cases like this, scammers use lottery or prize winnings as a lure to obtain personal and financial information. Here are some points to consider and steps you can take:\n\n1. Suspicious Context and Unsolicited Contact:\n • If you did not enter or sign up for any lottery or promotion from Holland Casino Lotto International, then it’s a strong indication that the email is unsolicited.\n • Scammers often send emails claiming you’ve “won” a large sum of money to prompt you to engage and eventually divulge personal information or even pay fees for processing or processing taxes (even though no legitimate lottery would require an upfront fee).\n\n2. Red Flags in the Message:\n • The email includes unusual details like a “notarized affidavit of ownership” and specific instructions that seem designed to push you into a time-sensitive action.\n • References to EU and national authorities might be intended to lend the email an air of legitimacy.\n • Unusual email addresses and contact numbers that cannot be independently confirmed should raise your suspicions.\n\n3. What You Should Do:\n • Do not reply to the email or call the provided phone number. Scammers often use such contacts to further gather your personal details.\n • Do not provide any banking details, personal identification, or any other sensitive information.\n • Verify the legitimacy of any lottery or prize notification by contacting the organization directly through official channels.

My name is Dr. James Ngola, formerly the senior financial advisor to the late President Laurent-Désiré Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I am writing to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive matter requiring urgent international collaboration.  \n\nFollowing the tragic assassination of President Kabila on January 16, 2001, I was entrusted with overseeing a portion of government funds generated through legal diamond exports under his administration. These funds, totaling $25 million USD, were stored in diplomatic containers and relocated to a private security vault in Accra, Ghana, under my supervision. Due to ongoing political instability in the region, I am now seeking a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the secure transfer and investment of these assets.  \n\nYour name was recommended to me by Mr. Thomas Whitaker, a mutual contact within the International Chamber of Commerce, who described you as a reputable professional with expertise in cross-border financial management. While the full context of this arrangement was withheld from him for security reasons, I trust his judgment implicitly.  \n\nHere is the proposed arrangement:  \n1. Asset Transfer: The funds (currently held as gold-backed certificates at GhanaSafe Securities Ltd.) will be transferred to a designated account under your name.  \n2. Compensation: You will retain 20% of the total sum ($5 million USD) for your assistance.  \n3. Investment: The remaining 75% ($18.75 million USD) will be allocated to joint ventures in your country, with your guidance.  \n4. Expenses: A 5% contingency fund ($1.25 million USD) will cover administrative costs, including legal fees and secure transport.  \n\nAll documentation—including certificates of deposit, customs clearance records, and diplomatic authorization letters—is prepared and verifiable. This transaction carries no legal risk, as the assets were formally declared to international auditors in 2000 and are unrelated to current DRC governance.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+233 55 712 3091) by Friday, October 27. I will then arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the paperwork and finalize logistics. Due to the time-sensitive nature of this matter, discretion is paramount.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former DRC Presidential Office)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233 55 712 3091  \n\nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits the classic signs of a scam and should be approached with extreme caution. Here are some key points and recommendations for handling it:\n\n1. Signs It May Be a Scam:\n   • The unexpected nature of the proposal: If you haven’t knowingly entered into any international financial dealings, an unsolicited proposal promising you a large sum of money is a red flag.\n   • Urgency and secrecy: Scammers often use urgent deadlines (“by Friday, October 27”) and stress confidentiality (“strict confidentiality,” “discretion is paramount”) to pressure you into acting quickly without due diligence.\n   • Unverified claims and credentials: The sender claims to have held a high-level position and mentions large sums of money from obscure operations. These details are hard to verify and often serve as tempting hooks.\n   • Unofficial and generic email address: The use of a free webmail account (e.g., jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com) for a supposedly high-level international transaction is uncommon and suspicious.\n   • Vague or inconsistent details: Information regarding the origin of the funds, the exact mechanism for transferring them, and their legal status is intentionally vague, which is common in scam communications.\n\n2. Recommended Action:\n   • Do Not Respond: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information. Any request to contact them will only lead to further attempts by the scammer.\n   • Do Not Provide Personal or Financial Information: Legitimate business proposals will never ask for your personal or banking details via an unverified email.\n   • Mark It as Spam/Phishing: Use your email service’s built-in function to flag or delete the message as spam. This helps your provider improve filters and protects you from future scams.\n   • Do Not Click Any Links or Download Attachments: They might contain malware that could compromise your system.\n   • Consult a Trusted Expert: If you remain unsure, consider asking for the advice of a trusted financial advisor or the IT/security department (if this is a work-related account).\n   • Stay Informed: Familiarize yourself with common scam tactics, as many use similar narratives (the “Nigerian prince” or “confidential business proposal” scam style).\n\nGiven these points, it would be best not to engage with this email. Paying attention could mean exposing yourself to potential risks (such as phishing, malware, or scams designed to obtain your personal information). Always maintain a healthy skepticism when receiving unsolicited offers that seem too good to be true."

My name is Prince Obong Abbot, first son of the late His Royal Majesty, Obong Daniel Eleme, Eze I of Eleme Kingdom in Rivers State, Nigeria. I am writing to propose a mutually beneficial partnership regarding an inheritance of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United States Dollars) held in a secure offshore facility.  \n\nBackground:  \nThe funds originated from royalties paid to my late father by international oil companies operating in Eleme Province. These royalties were compensation for agricultural land rendered unusable due to oil exploration. Prior to his passing, my father deposited the funds in two sealed containers with Global Secure Holdings Ltd., a private security firm in Lagos, under an open beneficiary arrangement. As his sole heir, I am legally entitled to these assets but require a trusted international partner to facilitate their transfer and investment abroad.  \n\nProposal:  \n1. Your Role: Act as the named beneficiary to facilitate the release and transfer of the funds to a secure account in your country.  \n2. Compensation:  \n   - 30% of the total sum as your fee.  \n   - 10% allocated for administrative costs (legal fees, logistics, etc.).  \n   - 5% dedicated to charitable initiatives of your choice.  \n   - 55% to be jointly invested in sustainable ventures under my family’s guidance.  \n\nGuarantees:  \n- The funds are legally sourced, with documentation verifying their origin.  \n- No governmental, illicit, or restricted entities are involved.  \n- Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest via email. I will provide the security deposit codes and liaise with the holding firm to initiate the process.  \n2. Upon transfer completion, I will travel to meet you in person to finalize investment plans.  \n\nContact Details:  \n- Email: obong.eleme@epatra-ng.com  \n- Phone: +234 80 7654 3210 (WhatsApp available)  \n\nThis opportunity is time-sensitive, as delays risk forfeiture under Nigerian probate regulations.

        "one-round response": "This email shows many classic signs of a scam—specifically the notorious “Nigerian prince” or advance-fee scam. Here are several red flags and recommended steps:\n\n• Suspicious Origin and Claims: The email makes grand claims about a huge inheritance and uses an overly dramatic title (e.g., “Chief Daniel Eleme, PhD” and “Prince Obong Abbot”) with story elements that seem contrived. Legitimate business proposals rarely use such inflated language or approach strangers with personal “royal” backgrounds.\n\n• Unverified Details: There’s no way to independently verify the sender’s identity or the legitimacy of the claims. The story about sealed containers and offshore funds from agricultural royalties is inconsistent with standard banking or legal practices.\n\n• Request for Partnership Without Any Prior Relationship: The proposal is unsolicited and proposes that you act as an intermediary to transfer money, which is a common scam tactic aimed at getting you to provide personal or financial information.\n\n• Urgency and Confidentiality: Scammers often try to pressure victims by emphasizing time-sensitivity and confidentiality, making you feel compelled to act quickly without proper due diligence.\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\n1. Do Not Respond: It’s best to ignore the email entirely. Any response can lead to further attempts to engage you or extract personal details.\n\n2. Do Not Share Personal Information: Under no circumstance should you provide personal, tax, or banking information in response to this email.\n\n3. Mark as Spam/Report: Use your email platform’s “mark as spam” function to report the email. If you want, you can also report it to local authorities or cybercrime help centers in your country.\n\n4. Verify with Trusted Sources: If you’re genuinely curious about opportunities, rely only on verified, reputable sources. Do thorough research before accepting any business proposal—especially one with such extraordinary claims.\n\nIn summary, treat this email as a scam. The safest course of action is to delete the email and not engage further, rather than “paying attention” to it."

Red flags:\n  • The email promises a large sum of money (USD $15,000,000.00) with a request to act as a beneficiary—a classic bait in advance fee or fraudulent inheritance scams.\n  • It asks for highly sensitive personal information and banking details, which scammers use to steal your identity or defraud you.\n  • The narrative and language seem designed to create urgency (“urgent attention” and a hard deadline) and to appeal to emotions, both common tactics used in scams.\n  • The sender’s credentials are unverifiable and it’s unlikely a legitimate banking official would make such a request via an unsolicited email.\n\n2. How to handle this:\n  • Do NOT reply to the email or provide any personal or financial information.\n  • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.\n  • If you’re curious or concerned in any way, check the details independently. For example, contact your bank or look up the official website of the mentioned bank to verify any legitimate communication.\n  • Report the email to your local consumer protection or cybercrime authority. In the U.S., for example, you could report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); other countries have similar agencies.\n  • If you have any security software or IT support, run a scan to ensure that your system hasn’t been compromised by interacting with the email.\n\nBottom line: It’s best to disregard and delete this email. If something seems “too good to be true,” especially when it involves confidential financial transactions and personal data, it most likely is. Stay safe by keeping your private information secure and verifying unsolicited communications through trusted channels."

Here are some points to consider and a recommended course of action:\n\n1. Suspicious context and overemphasis on urgency:  \n • The claim involves “accessing critical government funds” for humanitarian efforts during a sensitive political transition. While this may seem appealing, such narratives are common in financial scams.  \n • Urgency and a request for a “discreet collaboration” alongside instructions for encrypted communication can be tactics to bypass regular scrutiny and make you act without due diligence.\n\n2. Unsolicited contact from an unfamiliar sender:  \n • If you have no previous relationship or professional connection with someone who held that role, receiving such a request out of the blue should raise a red flag.  \n • High-value financial matters, especially those involving international funds, generally involve thorough verification and legal procedures—not an unsolicited email.\n\n3. Potential for phishing or misuse of personal information:  \n • Directing you to communicate over platforms like WhatsApp/Signal via personal numbers and email may be an attempt to lure you into a less secure communication channel where scammers can gather more personal data or initiate fraudulent transactions.\n\n4. Recommended actions:  \n • Do not reply or click on any links or attachments.  \n • Avoid sharing any personal or sensitive information.  \n • Mark the email as spam or report it to your organization’s IT/security team if you received it on a work account.  \n • If you’re unsure about its legitimacy, you could do an independent search or contact known, official channels related to the mentioned organization—but be careful not to use any contact details provided in the email.\n\nIn summary, it’s best not to pay attention to or engage with this email until you can independently verify its authenticity through official means. The characteristics of the email strongly suggest that it is likely a scam."

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am reaching out regarding a confidential financial matter that requires a trustworthy partner. While I understand this contact is unexpected, I was compelled to write after reviewing your professional background on LinkedIn, which suggests you have expertise in international business development.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Albert Edmond, was a former Minister of Infrastructure in Côte d’Ivoire. Before his assassination in 2019, he secured $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in a bonded vault with Securité Afrique SA, a licensed security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son Émile (23) and I seek to transfer these funds abroad for safekeeping and investment.  \n\nWe propose the following arrangement:  \n\n1. Asset Transfer: The funds will be shipped via diplomatic courier to your address as “industrial machinery parts” to avoid scrutiny. A notarized Power of Attorney will authorize you to receive the shipment.  \n2. Investment Strategy: We aim to allocate the capital across three sectors in your country:  \n   - Commercial real estate (shopping centers/office spaces)  \n   - Logistics/transportation (last-mile delivery fleet)  \n   - Hospitality (midscale boutique hotels, not 5-star)  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 20% ($1,700,000) of the total for your assistance. The remainder will be managed jointly through a registered holding company.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to AML regulations, with legal documentation prepared by our family attorney, Mr. Kwame Adjekum (kwame.adjekum@cabinet-legal.ci). Due to security concerns, I regret that we cannot communicate by phone until mutual verification is complete.  \n\nIf agreeable, kindly reply within 72 hours to monica.edmond@pmail.ci with a scanned copy of your government-issued ID and a secure mailing address.

        "one-round response": "This email bears many of the hallmarks of a scam—often referred to as an “advance fee” or “419” scam—and you should treat it with extreme caution. Here are several red flags and recommendations:\n\n1. Red Flags:\n • Unexpected Opportunity: You weren’t expecting this contact, and the sender’s narrative (a large sum of money needing overseas transfer) is a common scam storyline.\n • Urgency and Confidentiality: The email pressures you to respond within 72 hours and uses secrecy (e.g., “diplomatic courier,” “confidential financial matter”) to bypass normal scrutiny.\n • Request for Personal Information: The request for a scanned government-issued ID and a secure mailing address is a common tactic used to gather personal details that could be misused.\n • Unverifiable Credentials: While the sender references a professional background and legal contacts, the evidence provided (email address, phone number, LinkedIn link) is not enough to confirm legitimacy.\n • Suspicious Arrangement: The proposed method of transferring funds—as “industrial machinery parts”—is unusual and intended to mask the true nature of the transaction.\n\n2. Appropriate Response:\n • Do Not Reply: Don’t respond to the email or provide any personal or financial information.\n • Do Not Click Attachments or Links: Avoid clicking any attachments or external links, as they might contain malware or lead to phishing websites.\n • Mark as Spam/Report It: If you’re using a work or personal email client, mark the email as spam. You might also consider reporting it to your email provider.\n • Verify Independently: If, by chance, the opportunity seems unusually compelling given your professional standing, independently research and verify all details. However, in cases like this one, it’s best to assume that it’s a scam.\n\n3. General Advice:\n • Exercise Caution: Scammers often leverage high-pressure tactics and overly enticing proposals to make you act hastily. It is safer to ignore unexpected, unsolicited offers that seem too good to be true.\n • Consult with Experts: If you’re ever in doubt, speak with a trusted IT or cybersecurity professional before taking any further action.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email. The safest course of action is to delete it and cut off any further communication with the sender."

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am reaching out to you under strict confidentiality to propose a legitimate business opportunity that requires your cooperation.  \n\nDuring a routine audit review, I identified a dormant account with a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four Dollars, Twenty-Two Cents). The account belongs to Mr. Pierre Johnson, a German national and former client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a motor accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate his next of kin or legal heirs, no beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nAs the account holder left no will and has no documented relatives, our institution is legally obligated to transfer the funds to a verified beneficiary or release them to the state after a statutory period. To prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating with you to process a lawful claim as Mr. Johnson’s designated next of kin. All documentation, including the death certificate, account records, and legal affidavits, has been prepared to facilitate this process.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds will be transferred through our affiliate, Citibank Online (Madrid Branch), directly to your nominated account.  \n- Continental Bank’s internal approval is required to initiate the transfer, which I will oversee.  \n- The process adheres to international banking protocols and carries no financial risk to you.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via reply. I will then provide a step-by-step outline of the claim procedure. For urgent inquiries, you may contact me directly at +229 97 45 63 21 (my private line) or via encrypted email: myussuf@continentalbank.bj.  \n\nThis matter is time-sensitive, as unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture under Beninese law after 31 December 2023. Your discretion is paramount to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Mohamed Yussuf  \nHead of Audit Department  \nContinental Bank, Cotonou  \nTel: +229 97 45 63 21  \nEmail: myussuf@continentalbank.bj  \nWebsite: www.continentalbank-bj.com  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

Why it’s likely a scam:\n  • The email promises a windfall from a “dormant account” and asks you to act as a beneficiary.

What you should do:\n  • Do NOT respond to the email or provide any personal or financial information.\n  • Do not click on any links or attachments in the email.\n  • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client to help filter out similar messages in the future.\n  • If you’re concerned or want to be extra cautious, you can forward the email to your email provider’s abuse department.\n  • Consider running an antivirus scan on your computer if you suspect you’ve clicked on any suspicious links.\n\nIn summary, ignore and delete the email.

Why You Should Be Cautious:  \n  • Responding to such emails may expose you to identity theft, phishing attacks, or even requests for advance fees or other forms of fraud.  \n  • Engaging with scammers can sometimes lead to further unsolicited contact or more sophisticated social engineering attempts.\n\n3. How to Handle It:  \n  • Do Not Respond: It’s best to ignore the email.  \n  • Mark as Spam/Junk: Use your email provider’s tools to mark the message as spam so that similar emails can be filtered out in the future.  \n  • Do Not Click Any Links or Download Attachments: These could be harmful or lead to additional scams.  \n  • Report It (Optional): If you feel it’s necessary, report the scam to your email provider or to local authorities/consumer protection agencies who handle fraud complaints.\n\n4. General Advice:  \n  • Stay Alert: If an offer sounds too good to be true or has emotional manipulation elements, take a step back and review the details carefully.  \n  • Verify Independently: If you ever receive unsolicited emails requesting assistance with financial transactions or sensitive information, independently verify the sender's identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.\n\nIn summary, this email is most likely a scam, and the appropriate course of action is to not engage with it, mark it as spam, and consider reporting it to the relevant authorities."

Likely Scam Characteristics:\n   • An unsolicited inheritance claim—even if it sounds generous—aims to trick you into providing personal details.\n   • The sender’s email domain (barclays-uk.co) is not an official Barclays domain, which typically uses \"@barclays.co.uk\".\n   • Urgency in the message (a strict deadline and limited window for response) is a common tactic used by fraudsters to pressure recipients.\n   • Requesting sensitive personal information (such as your government-issued ID) without any prior relationship or verification raises major red flags.\n   • The offer of a “share” of 60% in exchange for you acting as a beneficiary is an unusual arrangement that does not align with standard banking practices.\n\n2. Appropriate Actions to Take:\n   • Do Not Respond: Avoid engaging with the sender or providing any personal or financial information.\n   • Do Not Click or Download Anything: If the email contains links or attachments, do not click or download them as they could be used to compromise your security.\n   • Verify Independently: If you have any concerns or questions regarding genuine communications from Barclays or any financial institution, use the contact information available on the official website or call their verified customer service numbers.\n   • Report the Email: Consider reporting this email as phishing or fraud to:\n     – Your email provider.\n     – The official fraud or cybersecurity team at Barclays via their verified methods.\n     – Relevant regulators or consumer protection agencies in your country.\n   • Delete the Email: Once reported, remove the email from your inbox to avoid any accidental interactions in the future.\n\nIn summary, there's no reason to engage with this email.

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the late Head of State of Nigeria (1993–1998). I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Association of Commerce, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of assisting with a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s passing in 1998, I have faced sustained pressure from governmental authorities seeking to confiscate assets linked to his estate. Recent audits have uncovered approximately $700 million in overseas accounts, which the current administration claims were improperly acquired. While I dispute these allegations, my ability to challenge them is restricted due to ongoing surveillance and travel restrictions imposed on me.  \n\nCurrently, $35 million USD is held in a private security vault under a confidential agreement with a European fiduciary firm. Due to my legal status, I am unable to access these funds directly. I seek your assistance in transferring this amount to a secure bank account under your name. Upon successful completion, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million) as compensation, with the remainder allocated to my relocation and legal defense.  \n\nMy family’s legal counsel, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu (aliyu_legal@abachalawfirm.ng; +234 809 876 5432), will coordinate all documentation and logistics. Due to monitoring of my communications, I request that you respond directly to this email (mariam.abacha@mariamabacha.net) and copy barrister.aliyu@abachalawfirm.ng to initiate proceedings.  \n\nThis request is made in strict confidence. Should you decline, I ask only for your discretion, as publicity would exacerbate my current situation. No financial risk is involved, as all transfer fees and legal safeguards have been prearranged.  \n\nI await your prompt reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nHajia Mariam Abacha  \n——  \nContact Assurance:  \n- Primary Email: mariam.abacha@mariamabacha.net  \n- Legal Counsel: Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu | +234 809 876 5432 | barrister.aliyu@abachalawfirm.ng  \nNote: For security reasons, avoid mentioning this correspondence via phone or unsecured channels.",

        "one-round response": "This email has all the hallmarks of a scam and appears to be part of a long-established \"advance-fee fraud\" scheme, sometimes referred to as a \"Nigerian prince\" scam. Here are some key points and steps you should consider:\n\n1. Suspicious Details:  \n • The sender claims to be related to a prominent political figure and mixes legitimate-sounding details with a request that is highly unusual.  \n • The email involves a large sum of money and a promise of a substantial commission (20%), which is a common tactic used by scammers to lure victims.  \n • The language and formatting may try to create an aura of urgency and confidentiality, another red flag.\n\n2. No Action Is Required:  \n • Do not reply to the email. Engaging further can expose you to additional phishing attempts or attempts to gather personal information.  \n • Do not click on any links or download any attachments that might be included, as these could be used to install malware or compromise your security.\n\n3. Reporting the Email:  \n • Mark the email as spam or junk so that your email provider can automatically filter similar messages in the future.  \n • If you work with an employer’s IT or security team, inform them of the email so they can take appropriate precautions.\n • If you wish to take further action, report the email to your local cybercrime unit or the appropriate authority in your country. In some regions, there are government agencies and online portals dedicated to reporting fraud and scam attempts.\n\n4. Staying Safe in the Future:  \n • Be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those involving financial transactions or promises of large sums of money.\n • Verify any contact details and claims using independent sources if you happen to receive similar messages in the future.\n • Familiarize yourself with common scam tactics so that you can spot red flags early.\n\nIn summary, this email is almost certainly a scam. There is no legitimate reason to engage with it. The best course of action is to delete the email, mark it as spam, and report it to your IT department or local authorities if needed. Your caution and vigilance will help protect you against potential fraud or cyber threats."

        "one-round response": "This email raises several red flags that suggest caution is warranted:\n\n1. Suspicious email details and language:\n • The email claims you’ve won a large sum (€500,000), which is a common tactic used in scams.\n • The sender’s email address and contact information (including a foreign phone number and fax) do not align with what you might expect from a well-established casino.\n • The tone and urgency (e.g., contacting within 48 hours, strict deadlines) are often used to pressure recipients into acting hastily—another common scam tactic.\n\n2. How it deviates from standard legitimate communications:\n • Legitimate lottery or prize notifications from established institutions typically require you to verify your identity via secure, official channels and usually do not require you to share a copy of your government-issued ID before confirming details.\n • Official websites and contact information are usually consistent. Here, the email uses a website (“hollandcasino-promotions.nl”) that is different from the well-known official website (“hollandcasino.nl”), which should prompt additional caution.\n\n3. Recommended actions:\n • Do not reply, call, or send any personal or financial information using the contact details provided in the email.\n • Independently verify the legitimacy of the offer by contacting the organization through verified channels. For example, if you believe it might be from Holland Casino, visit their official website (https://www.hollandcasino.nl) and use the contact information provided there, or call their official customer service.\n • Be skeptical of any communication that confers a prize unexpectedly—legitimate promotions usually require you to sign up or participate through official, secure, and fully-transparent processes.\n • Consider reporting the email to your email provider as spam or phishing, so they can help take appropriate measures.\n\nIn summary, do not act on this email until you have independently verified its legitimacy. It is very likely a scam, and handling it with caution by not sharing any sensitive information is the appropriate way to proceed."

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your collaboration in resolving a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing President Kabila’s tragic assassination on January 16, 2001, during a private meeting to review proceeds from state-managed diamond exports, I was entrusted with overseeing $100 million USD in diplomatic assets. These funds, stored in three sealed diplomatic containers, were routed through Zimbabwe and later dispersed to ensure their security during the ensuing political instability.  \n\nA portion of these funds, amounting to $25 million USD, was converted to gold reserves and deposited under my authority with Accra Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed security firm in Ghana, where I currently reside as a political refugee. Due to my status, I require a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the transfer of these assets into a secure international account for future investment.  \n\nYour name was recommended by Mr. Daniel Clarke, a member of the International Chamber of Commerce based in Accra, who attested to your professionalism and discretion. While he is unaware of the specifics, he confirmed your reliability for such a critical undertaking.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will act as the beneficiary of the funds, enabling their transfer to your account.  \n2. Upon successful clearance, you will retain 20% ($5 million USD) as compensation.  \n3. The remaining 75% will be allocated to long-term investments in your country under your guidance.  \n4. A 5% reserve will cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nAll documentation, including certificates of deposit, diplomatic seals, and ownership affidavits, is secured. The funds carry no public record, as they were designated for presidential use and bypassed official channels.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly respond to this email or contact me directly at +233-27-195-3892 (Ghana) within 48 hours. I will arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the documentation and finalize the transfer. Your discretion is paramount, as premature disclosure could jeopardize this transaction.  \n\nI look forward to your urgent reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former)  \nOffice of the President, DRC (1997–2001)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233-27-153-2915  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

Notice the red flags:\n  • The email comes from a generic, free email address rather than an official domain.\n  • It features an enticing financial opportunity involving large sums of money.\n  • The story about confidential funds tied to high-profile political figures is highly contrived.\n  • You are asked to act as a beneficiary of funds, which is unusual for any genuine business transaction.\n  • There’s a request for prompt action and discretion, which is a common tactic to rush decisions without proper verification.\n\n2. Likelihood of Fraud:\n  • Scammers send these types of messages broadly, hoping someone will respond without checking the details.\n  • Legitimate financial institutions or government-related proposals do not operate this way.\n\n3. How to handle it:\n  • Do not reply or provide any personal or financial information.\n  • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.\n  • If you’re concerned about your security, run a virus scan or check with your IT department.\n  • Consider reporting the email to your local authorities or to organizations that handle cyber fraud (such as the FTC if you're in the United States, or similar agencies in your area).\n\n4. Protect yourself:\n  • Never send money or bank details to an unverified source.\n  • Research and verify any unsolicited communications involving large sums of money, particularly when they come with urgent time limits.\n  • If an offer sounds too good to be true—especially with claims of substantial rewards for minimal effort—it very likely is a scam.\n\nIn summary, you should disregard this email and avoid any further engagement. It's best to keep your personal information secure and to report suspicious communications to the proper channels."

My name is Mrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi, widow of the late Dr. Jonas Savimbi, former leader of the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA). After years of silence, I am compelled to seek your assistance due to extraordinary circumstances.  \n\nMy husband, who survived numerous attempts on his life, was tragically killed in 2002 during a clash with Angolan government forces. Before his passing, he secured USD 16,400,000.00 (Sixteen Million Four Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in the form of precious assets, deposited with a private security firm in South Africa. This fund was accrued through legitimate sales of gold and diamonds during his leadership.  \n\nFollowing his death, my family and I faced relentless persecution. While my eldest son and I remain under house arrest in Angola, my younger son, Peter Savimbi, escaped to South Africa under political asylum. Regrettably, South African law restricts refugees from conducting major financial transactions, leaving him unable to claim the assets.  \n\nI am reaching out to you—guided by faith and necessity—to request your partnership. We propose appointing you as the legal beneficiary to facilitate the transfer. In return, you will retain 30% of the total sum for your cooperation, with the remaining 70% allocated to securing my family’s future upon our release.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact my son directly via:  \nEmail: petersavimbi8@webmail.co.za  \nAlternate Email: petersavimbi5@webmail.co.za  \nPhone: +27 72 434 0319 (South Africa)  \n\nRequired Details for Documentation:  \n1.

The message asks you to provide personal information and to act as a “partner” in transferring a large sum of money. Similar tactics are commonly used in advance-fee scams (sometimes referred to as \"Nigerian Prince\" scams).\n\n• The narrative is designed to evoke sympathy and urgency, which are common psychological techniques used to lower your guard.\n\n• There is no credible verification of the sender’s identity or the legitimacy of the claims. Genuine financial institutions or legal entities do not conduct business through unsolicited emails that ask for personal data for such transactions.\n\n• The email requests sensitive personal details. Sharing such information could lead to identity theft or further phishing attempts.\n\nWhat you should do:\n\n1. Do not reply or engage with the sender in any way.\n2.

Recent developments have compelled me to seek your discreet support.  \n\nAs reported by international media, the United Nations and current Liberian administration have renewed demands for my husband’s repatriation to face trial. This has placed my family under severe scrutiny, with our financial assets frozen and personal safety at risk. Amidst these pressures, I must act swiftly to secure remaining funds earmarked for my children’s welfare.  \n\nA portion of my husband’s estate, totaling $30,270,000.00 (Thirty Million Two Hundred and Seventy Thousand US Dollars), remains held in a private custodial account outside Liberia. Due to heightened surveillance, I cannot access these funds directly without alerting authorities. My legal advisors propose transferring ownership temporarily to a trusted third party until proceedings conclude.  \n\nIn confidence, I request your assistance as a custodian to facilitate this transfer. For your cooperation, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($6,054,000.00) as compensation. All documentation and legal safeguards will be provided to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nTime is critical. Kindly reply urgently to jeandcine@yahoo.co.uk to confirm your willingness to proceed.

        "one-round response": "This email is almost certainly a scam—a type of \"advance-fee fraud\" message—which is commonly used to trick recipients into becoming involved in illegitimate financial schemes. Here are some steps to appropriately handle the situation:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information. Legitimate entities, especially those involved in legal or governmental matters, would not ask you to keep transactions confidential by using such an unprofessional method (for example, using a free email service like Yahoo).\n\n2. Do Not Click Any Links or Open Attachments: If there are any links or attachments, do not click or download them, as these could be vehicles for malware.\n\n3. Mark as Spam/Phishing: Use your email provider’s options to mark the email as spam or report it as phishing. This helps to protect others from eventually receiving similar fraudulent messages.\n\n4. Delete the Email: Once marked, it’s best to delete the email from your inbox to avoid any accidental future interactions.\n\n5. Be Cautious with Unsolicited Offers: Unexpected offers promising large sums of money, particularly when they require some form of \"upfront\" action, are almost always scams. Professionals involved in such transactions would use secure, traceable methods and official channels.\n\nIf you ever feel uncertain about an email’s authenticity, consider checking with a trusted professional or contacting the customer support service of your email provider for assistance.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to engage with this email. The best approach is to mark it as spam and delete it, ensuring that you do not share any personal details or engage further."

Unsolicited Offer: You weren’t expecting any confidential business proposal, yet this email arrives out of the blue.\n\n2. Too Good to Be True: A high-value offer combined with a large commission percentage is a common tactic used to lure potential victims.\n\n3. Urgency and Pressure: The sender emphasizes time sensitivity and demands quick action, which is designed to prevent you from taking the time to properly verify the details.\n\n4. Questionable Sources: The sender claims to be a senior official in a government ministry but uses generic email addresses and details that don’t prove his legitimacy. Official communications from government agencies typically follow strict protocols and use verified institutional channels.\n\n5. Confidentiality and Secrecy: The email stresses confidentiality and legal vetting but provides little verifiable evidence. It’s best to be cautious if someone insists on using encrypted communication or makes you maintain secrecy without any official documentation.\n\nBased on these observations, the appropriate steps would be:\n\n• Do Not Respond: Do not share any personal information or engage further with the sender. Replying can sometimes lead to additional attempts to solicit sensitive information.\n\n• Mark as Spam or Junk: Flag the email as spam so that your email provider can learn to filter similar messages in the future.\n\n• Report It: Consider reporting this email to your local cybercrime unit or your country’s fraud authority. In the U.S., for example, you can report scam emails to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). If you’re elsewhere, check with your national consumer protection or cybercrime authorities.\n\n• Inform Your IT/Security Team: If you’re at work and this email was received on a corporate account, inform your IT department so they can take additional protective measures and alert other users if needed.\n\nIn summary, this email is almost certainly a scam. The best and safest course of action is to ignore it, mark it as spam, and report it to the appropriate authorities."

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed estate linked to Mr. Allen Duke, a valued client of our institution who, tragically, passed away in an aviation accident on January 30, 2000, alongside his immediate family.  \n\nPer our records, Mr. Duke held a deposit of USD 4,800,000.00 (Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) at the time of his demise. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin or lawful beneficiaries, no claimants have surfaced in over six years. Under UK banking regulations (Section 17.4 of the Financial Administration Act), dormant accounts exceeding a five-year unclaimed period are subject to forfeiture to the Crown Estate.  \n\nGiven the urgency of this matter, I propose a confidential collaboration to secure these funds before the statutory deadline of October 31, 2006.

By acting as a designated beneficiary, we can legally redirect these assets under probate court guidelines.  \n\nKey Process Overview:  \n1. Submission of a sworn affidavit (prepared by our legal team) confirming your status as Mr. Duke’s distant relative.  \n2. Transfer of funds to a jointly nominated offshore account within 7–10 business days.  \n3.

Mark the email as spam or phishing, and delete it from your inbox.  \n4.

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits many hallmarks of a scam and should be treated with extreme caution. Here are several reasons why you should not engage with this email:\n\n1. Unsolicited Offer: The email promises a large sum of money from a business deal you may not even recall participating in. Legitimate business transactions do not typically involve receiving unexpected payments or compensation without prior, verifiable details.\n\n2. Pressure to Act Quickly: The email urges you to provide personal information immediately to avoid “procedural delays.” Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure victims into sharing sensitive information without taking the time for due diligence.\n\n3. Questionable Sender Details: The sender’s email address and other contact information (including names and institutions) are not accompanied by verifiable or professional details. The alleged bank and account officer details may also be fabricated or misrepresented.\n\n4. Poor Verification: Genuine financial institutions and business transactions involve proper identification, secure channels, and official documentation—often not sent by personal email from private accounts.\n\n5. Previous Communication Claims: The email mentions past discussions regarding the venture, which may be an attempt to lend credibility to a completely fabricated story.\n\nAppropriate Actions to Take:\n\n• Do Not Respond: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal, financial, or identifying information such as your full legal name, telephone number, or bank account details.\n\n• Mark as Spam/Phishing: Use your email provider’s tools to mark this email as spam or phishing so that future messages from the same source are filtered out.\n\n• Report the Email: Consider reporting the email to your local consumer protection agency or relevant law enforcement, as well as the anti-fraud divisions (such as the Internet Crime Complaint Center in the United States, if applicable). You may also check with your bank to see if they have encountered similar scam attempts.\n\n• Do Not Click any Links or Attachments: Avoid clicking on any embedded links or downloading any attachments, as these may contain malware or further compromise your personal information.\n\nStaying cautious with unsolicited financial offers is key. If you are ever in doubt about the legitimacy of such an email, it is always best to consult directly with trusted professionals or institutions using contact information from official sources rather than those provided by the suspicious message.\n\nIn summary, pay no attention to this email, and proceed with caution by marking and reporting it accordingly."

My name is Jones Martin, an independent financial consultant based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive matter involving an unclaimed asset deposit of US$25,000,000.00 held under a diplomatic storage arrangement in Europe.  \n\nBackground of the Transaction:  \nIn 2003, I was contracted by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi) to facilitate a private equity partnership with a Venezuelan oil conglomerate. The investment matured in 2005, and both parties agreed to liquidate the funds in cash to avoid substantial IRS tax liabilities. A senior banker at Mizuhara Trust Bank (New York branch) coordinated the withdrawal and discreet transfer of the funds to a secure storage facility in Luxembourg, registered under a pseudonym.  \n\nThe assets were stored as \"family valuables\" to comply with logistics protocols, with full documentation (certificates, access codes, and keys) entrusted to me. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, leaving the deposit dormant and legally unresolved.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nThe storage facility’s management has issued repeated notifications since December 2023 to finalize the retrieval process. As the sole surviving executor, I am legally authorized to appoint a designated beneficiary to claim the assets. Due to geopolitical sensitivities and strict confidentiality requirements, I require a trustworthy partner to act as the beneficiary under a pre-negotiated agreement.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n- You will be registered as the temporary beneficiary via a notarized power of attorney (pre-drafted in 2005).  \n- The storage facility in Luxembourg will release the assets upon verification of your identity and my authorization.  \n- A 7% commission (US$1,750,000.00) will be allocated to you for your assistance, with the remainder repatriated to the investor’s estate.  \n\nThis process is structured to comply with all applicable regulations, and I will provide full documentation for due diligence. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf willing to proceed, kindly confirm your interest by reply email or contact me directly at +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica) or jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com. I will arrange a secure call to discuss timelines and logistics.  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to prevent asset forfeiture. I look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nIndependent Financial Consultant  \nKingston, Jamaica  \nEmail: jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198  \n\nNote: All documentation is available for review, including the 2005 storage agreement and power of attorney.",

        "one-round response": "This email shows many red flags that indicate it is most likely a scam—and you should treat it with extreme caution. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Unsolicited Contact and Urgency: The email comes out of the blue and emphasizes an “urgent” opportunity for you to act quickly. Scammers often use urgency to prevent you from taking time to think or verify details.\n\n2. Overly Complex Story: The narrative involves unusual elements such as diplomatic storage accounts, pseudonyms for legitimate institutions, a historical connection to a hurricane, and a large sum of money. Legitimate financial matters rarely require such an elaborate backstory.\n\n3. Request for Your Involvement: They ask you to become a beneficiary and provide personal information. This is common in scams where the intent is to either steal your personal data or trick you into sending money for “processing fees” or similar expenses later on.\n\n4. Unverified Contact Information: The sender uses a generic email provider (ProtonMail, in this case) and provides phone numbers that can’t be easily verified. Legitimate financial institutions or consultants usually have established, verifiable contact details.\n\n5. Legal and Regulatory Language: Scammers often mimic legal jargon (talking about notarized power of attorney or “pre-drafted documents”) to create an appearance of legitimacy. However, genuine financial recovery processes involve extensive checks and transparent regulatory oversight.\n\nWhat You Should Do:\n\n• Do Not Respond: Do not engage with the sender or provide any personal or financial information.\n  \n• Mark as Spam/Phishing: Flag the email as spam in your email client. Most email providers offer options to mark suspicious emails as phishing/scam, which may help protect others.\n\n• Consult Trusted Sources: If you’re in doubt about any financial correspondence, consult with a trusted financial advisor, legal counsel, or your bank. Do not use the contact information provided in the email for any verifications.\n\n• Report: Depending on your location, you might consider reporting the email to your local consumer protection or fraud prevention agency. In the U.S., for example, you could report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nThe bottom line is that this email has typical hallmarks of a scam. It’s best to ignore and delete it, and do not provide any sensitive information or money. Stay safe and always verify unsolicited offers through independent, trusted channels."

Here are some reasons for concern and suggestions on how to handle the situation:\n\n1. Red Flags in the Email:\n  • Unsolicited Offer: The email unexpectedly offers a large sum of money with little verification or context.\n  • Urgency and Pressure: It pushes for a quick response by citing regulatory deadlines and claiming a “time-sensitive” process.\n  • Request for Sensitive Information/Fees: It asks you to engage in legal paperwork and hints at reimbursing fees, which is a common tactic to mistakenly extract funds or personal details.\n  • Third-Party Involvement: It involves an international attorney and uses terminology meant to invoke legitimacy, but often scammers include such details to mimic formal communications.\n  • Mismatched Details: Official correspondence from actual financial institutions rarely asks individuals unknown to them to serve as a “legal representative” for an account they have no connection with.\n\n2. Recommended Actions:\n  • Do Not Respond: Avoid replying or providing any personal or financial details.\n  • Do Not Click on Any Links or Download Attachments: They might contain malware or lead to phishing sites.\n  • Report the Email: Forward the email as spam/phishing to your email provider. You might also report it to your local consumer protection agency or law enforcement if needed.\n  • Verify Independently: If you are in any way uncertain, contact the institution directly using publicly available contact information (such as from their verified official website or a known branch) rather than the details provided in the email.\n  • Delete the Email: Since it appears suspicious, it’s best to erase it from your inbox and trash.\n\nIn summary, you should be very cautious about this email.

I am writing to you in my capacity as the legal representative of the late Mr. Neil Frazer, a French national and former private contractor for Shell Petroleum Development Company in Senegal.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Frazer, his spouse, and their three children tragically perished in a vehicular accident near Dakar. Despite exhaustive efforts over the past two years—including liaising with the French Consulate, Interpol, and municipal registries—no next of kin or valid beneficiaries have been identified for Mr. Frazer’s estate.  \n\nPrior to his passing, Mr. Frazer held a secured trust account with FinanceSecurity Group (FSG), now valued at $21,000,000 USD.

Here’s why and what you should do:\n\n• Likely Scam Characteristics:\n – The email promises a very large sum of money for very little work on your part.\n – It requests personal information upfront.\n – There are several hallmarks of advance-fee schemes or “419 scams,” common in fraudulent emails.\n – The language used (such as urgent deadlines, “confidential arrangements,” and splitting funds) is typical of scams.\n – Official legal practitioners or financial institutions do not normally communicate in this way or ask you to provide private details via email.\n\n• Recommended Actions:\n 1. Do NOT reply or provide any personal or financial information.\n 2. Do not click on any links or contact any phone numbers provided in the email.\n 3. Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.\n 4. If you’re still concerned, you might consider reporting it to your local law enforcement or a consumer protection agency that deals with scams.\n 5. If in doubt about any unsolicited legal or financial offer in the future, consult with a trusted legal professional before taking any action.\n\nUltimately, you do not need to pay attention to this email—it is designed to lure recipients into a fraudulent arrangement. Stay safe, and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is."

This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for \ntermination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and \nthe oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid \npayment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of \nUS Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service IRS. \n \nA special \narrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with \nJapanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to \nterminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with \nan arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they \nprepared and handed over to The banker.\n \nI was directly involved, well \npaid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was \nwithdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault \ndelivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.\n \nThe real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was \ndelivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for \nthe storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys \nwere all handed over to me.\n \nMr. Takashi the Florida businessman was \nplanning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when \nthe unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster \nwhich claimed his life and that of the top banker.

My name is Jones Martin, a licensed financial consultant and broker based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive opportunity involving the collection of a US$25,000,000.00 asset held under a confidential arrangement.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, I was engaged by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi, now deceased) to facilitate an offshore oil investment partnership with a Venezuelan energy firm. The agreement concluded in 2005, with both parties opting to liquidate the investment in cash to minimize tax liabilities. A structured withdrawal was coordinated through a senior banker at Mitsuhashi Trust Bank (New York Branch) to transfer the funds to a secure vault facility in Luxembourg, managed by EuroSafe Financial Holdings.  \n\nThe assets were registered under a pseudonym with a bonded power of attorney, ensuring legal transferability. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina (August 2005), leaving the retrieval documents (storage certificates, access codes, and keys) solely in my custody.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nEuroSafe has issued repeated reminders since December 2023 to finalize the collection process. As the sole surviving authorized party, I am legally obligated to identify a collaborator to assume ownership via the pre-established power of attorney. This requires:  \n1. A notarized affidavit confirming your role as the beneficiary.  \n2. A joint visit to EuroSafe’s Luxembourg facility to validate credentials.  \n\nTerms & Assurance:  \n- Legality: All documentation complies with international fiduciary regulations.  \n- Confidentiality: A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be executed prior to further disclosure.  \n- Compensation: You will retain 30% of the retrieved funds for your participation; my fee is derived from the remaining portion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply promptly to jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm or call +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica office) to schedule a secure videoconference. Due to the sensitivity of this matter, I regret that I cannot disclose further details publicly.  \n\nKindly treat this correspondence with utmost discretion.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nLicensed Financial Consultant  \nMartin & Associates Consultancy Ltd.  \n12 Harbour Street, Kingston, Jamaica  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198 | Email: jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm  \n\nNote: All identifiers (names, institutions) have been altered for confidentiality.

Red Flags:\n • Unsolicited proposal: Unexpected emails promising large sums of money or exclusive business opportunities should be treated with extreme caution.\n • Pressure and urgency: Scammers often stress urgency (“time-sensitive opportunity”) to force hasty decisions.\n • Request for private information and legal documents: Demanding notarized affidavits, joint visits, or any legal paperwork in exchange for access to funds is a common scam tactic.\n • Unverifiable details: The story provided relies on unverifiable identities, offshore accounts, and institutions whose information is vague or fabricated.\n • Unusual terms for financial transactions: Legitimate financial deals rarely require an unknown party to participate without proper regulation and transparent processes.\n\n2. Recommended Action:\n • Do Not Respond: Do not provide any personal, financial, or legal information.\n • Mark as Spam/Junk: Report the email as spam in your email client so similar future messages are blocked.\n • Do Not Click on Any Links or Open Attachments: While this email may be a simulation, actual scam emails might include harmful links or attachments.\n • Inform Your IT Department or Trusted Advisor: If you’re connected with a workplace or have a trusted technology advisor, let them know about the email.\n • Report the Email: You can report suspicious emails to local authorities or a consumer protection agency (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission if you're in the US or your country's corresponding body).\n\n3. General Caution:\nAlways be skeptical about unsolicited offers involving large sums of money or urgent requests for sensitive information. If an email seems too good to be true or pressures you to act quickly without proper due diligence, it's best to ignore it and verify the information independently before taking any steps.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to engage with this email. The best course of action is to delete it, report it as spam, and remain vigilant about similar messages in the future."

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am writing to you with a confidential proposal that I believe aligns with your professional expertise. After reviewing your profile, I felt compelled to reach out, as your background suggests you may be well-suited to assist with a sensitive matter.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Jonathan Edmond, was a prominent political figure in Côte d’Ivoire. Before his tragic assassination in 2019, he secured a sum of $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a private security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son, Emmanuel, and I are unable to access these funds directly. We seek to relocate this capital abroad for safekeeping and investment in stable markets.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $8.5M USD held in a bonded consignment under diplomatic protocols.  \n- Objective: Transfer the funds to a trusted partner outside Africa to establish long-term investments.  \n- Proposed Sectors: Real estate development, transportation infrastructure, and hospitality (e.g., luxury hotels).  \n\nWe require a representative to act as the legal consignee for the transfer. The security firm will handle all logistics, including diplomatic clearance and shipment of documentation to your address. In exchange for your assistance, we propose allocating 20% of the total amount ($1.7M USD) to you, with the remainder earmarked for joint ventures in your region.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and availability.  \n2. Provide a secure mailing address to initiate the transfer process.  \n3. Collaborate on drafting an investment plan for the remaining funds.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this matter, I would be grateful for your discretion. You may contact me directly via email at monica.edmond@protonmail.com or by phone at +225 07 87 54 32 11 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred).  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith. My son and I are committed to ensuring all transactions comply with international due diligence standards, including a CLEE certification from the security firm.  \n\nThank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your response.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMonica Edmond  \nAbidjan, Côte d’Ivoire  \n\nP.S. Should this proposal not align with your current capacity, I kindly request confidentiality. Time is of moderate importance due to contractual obligations with the security firm.  \n\n---  \nThis email is formatted for clarity and realism, including plausible contact methods and procedural references (e.g., CLEE certification) common in international finance.

Here are some red flags and recommendations:\n\n• Unsolicited Offer: Legitimate financial institutions or high-level business proposals don’t typically reach out to random individuals with proposals like this, especially involving large sums of money.\n\n• Overly Attractive Terms: The promise of a large commission (20% of $8.5M) for minimal effort is a common lure used by scammers.\n\n• Emotional & Urgent Tone: Scammers often create a sense of urgency and appeal to emotions (e.g., tragedy, political instability) to bypass careful scrutiny.\n\n• Unverified Credentials: The sender’s claims about diplomatic protocols, a CLEE certification, and references to private security firms may sound plausible at a glance, but can be fabricated without verifiable evidence.\n\n• Confidentiality Request: Asking for discretion and confidentiality is another common tactic used to discourage the recipient from seeking advice or telling others about the offer.\n\nGiven these factors, here’s the appropriate way to handle the email:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Avoid engaging further or providing any personal or financial information such as your mailing address or details that could compromise your identity.\n\n2. Mark as Spam/Phishing: Use your email provider’s tools to mark the message as spam or phishing. This helps improve filters and protects you in the future.\n\n3. Do Not Click on Links or Attachments: If there are any, avoid clicking them as they might install malware on your system.\n\n4. Report It (if desired): Consider reporting the scam to your email provider or local authorities (such as your country’s cybercrime unit) so they can further investigate.\n\n5. Stay Informed: If you’re ever in doubt about such proposals, seek a second opinion from a trusted professional (such as a legal advisor, financial expert, or a representative from your bank) before taking any action.\n\nIn summary, this email is most likely a scam. It’s best to ignore it, mark it as spam, and not provide any personal information. Maintaining vigilance with unsolicited offers—especially those involving large sums of money or requests for sensitive details—is essential to avoid scams and potential fraud."

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

My name is David Bryan, and I serve as a Senior Portfolio Manager within the Private Wealth division.  \n\nIn 2003, a client (whose identity remains protected per privacy protocols) established a US$6,000,000 investment portfolio through our institution. This arrangement proceeded without incident until November 2004, when the client instructed us to liquidate the entirety of the holdings for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Following strict compliance protocols, we coordinated with an authorized affiliate agency to facilitate the transfer through Nordic SafeGuard Solutions – a discreet financial logistics firm specializing in high-value transactions for institutional clients.  \n\nThe client indicated plans to retrieve these funds personally within days of their deposit. However, no further contact was established. In June 2022, Nordic SafeGuard alerted us to the account’s prolonged dormancy. Subsequent investigations revealed the client had succumbed to cardiac arrest in Cannes, France, in May 2022. French authorities confirmed the identity through dental records, though no next of kin was listed in official documentation.  \n\nOur internal audit confirms you were identified through beneficiary tracing efforts as a potential familial connection. Strict anonymity protocols prevent me from disclosing specifics via conventional channels, hence this direct communication.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs sole custodian of the transaction codes required to release the funds, I propose establishing you as the legal beneficiary through documented kinship – a process requiring discreet collaboration. Upon successful transfer, we would equitably divide the assets (60% to you, 40% retained for administrative and compliance obligations). This structure protects both parties from institutional scrutiny given the account’s confidential nature.  \n\nCritical Security Protocols:  \n• Respond exclusively to d.bryan@pmail.com  \n• Mobile contact: +44 7911 123456 (Signal/WhatsApp preferred)  \n• Never reference this matter through official Kleinwort Benson channels  \n\nThis communication is time-sensitive and will self-retract if unanswered within 14 days. Should you decline involvement, simply disregard this message – no further action is required.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDavid Bryan  \nSenior Portfolio Manager  \nPrivate Wealth Division  \nKleinwort Benson",

Legitimate financial institutions do not contact potential beneficiaries with such vague details.\n\n• The email contains several instructions that are designed to encourage secrecy and the use of unofficial, untraceable communication channels (for example, using a non-corporate email address and mobile contacts on apps like Signal/WhatsApp).\n\n• The overall tone and structure of the email, including mentions of “strict anonymity protocols” and the promise of instant large payments split between you and the sender, are typical hallmarks of advance-fee fraud schemes.\n\nGiven these issues, the appropriate course of action is:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal or financial information. Any further communication could expose you to higher risks.\n\n2.

        "generated text": "\n\nSubject: Confidential Request for Assistance in Fund Transfer  \n\nDear Mr. James Carter,  \n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent agricultural entrepreneur and senior member of Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am reaching out to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, which I will explain briefly.  \n\nFollowing my father’s assassination by agents of the current government, I was forced to flee Zimbabwe for my safety. Prior to his death, my father secured USD $10,000,000 in the form of precious gemstones within a sealed trunk, deposited with a private security firm in Pretoria, South Africa. These funds were intended for agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini, including machinery procurement and farm development.  \n\nRegrettably, the Zimbabwean government has frozen all family assets and bank accounts, leaving me unable to access these resources. Due to my status as an asylum seeker, South African financial regulations (Section 12B of the Financial Regulations Act) prohibit me from directly claiming or investing such funds. This is why I require a trusted partner abroad to act as the legal recipient.  \n\nProposal:  \n- You would facilitate the transfer of the trunk to your country as the designated consignee.  \n- Upon successful retrieval, 15% ($1,500,000) will be allocated to you for your assistance.  \n- The remainder will fund my relocation and agricultural ventures, with potential opportunities for further collaboration.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the security company has imposed a 30-day deadline before imposing additional storage fees. All documentation, including the deposit certificate and my father’s will, is prepared for verification.  \n\nConfidentiality is critical, as any disclosure could jeopardize both our safety. For further discussion, please reply to this email or contact me at:  \n- Email: mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au  \n- Phone: +27 63 578 9012 (via secure messaging app Signal, if preferred).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this request and am prepared to provide any evidence needed to establish trust. Your discretion and prompt response would be deeply appreciated.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDesmond Martin Olds  \n(On behalf of the Olds Family Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: This communication is encrypted for security.

        "one-round response": "This email shows many of the common warning signs of a scam—often referred to as a \"419 scam\" or \"advance-fee fraud.\" Here are some key points to consider and steps you can take:\n\n1. Likely Scam Indicators:\n • Unsolicited Contact: If you didn’t have any prior relationship or expectations of such a request, it’s very suspicious.\n • Emotional Story & Urgency: The email uses a tragic personal story and a time-sensitive request to pressure you into acting quickly without proper verification.\n • Request for Personal Involvement: Scammers often try to involve you as a “trusted partner” to launder money or facilitate a fraudulent transfer, promising large rewards.\n • Confidentiality Emphasis: The repeated insistence on confidentiality is another tactic to keep you from discussing the situation with others who might recognize the fraudulent nature.\n\n2. How to Handle It:\n • Do Not Respond or Engage: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information.\n • Do Not Send Money or Share Sensitive Information: Legitimate financial transactions—especially those involving large amounts—will have verifiable legal and procedural safeguards. There’s no reason why you would be asked to send money or take possession of assets without proper institutional processes.\n • Mark as Spam/Report: Flag the email as spam in your email client and consider reporting it to your email provider for further investigation.\n • Stay Informed: Educate yourself about common online scams. Awareness is a key step in protecting yourself.\n • Consult a Trusted Source: If you’re ever uncertain about a financial proposal or request, consult with professionals or trusted contacts—a legal advisor or your bank can offer guidance.\n\n3. Final Thoughts:\nThe email is almost certainly a scam. It is designed to lure you into a fraudulent scheme quickly. Taking any further action could expose you to additional risks, including personal data theft or financial loss.\n\nIn summary, do not pay attention to the email, do not engage, and delete it. Stay vigilant and protect your personal information."

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. My late husband, Robert White, worked as an expatriate engineer with Chevron in Kenya for over two decades until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution (Banc Européen), which currently holds approximately $7.5 million USD (principal plus accrued interest).  \n\nSince my husband’s death, this account has remained dormant. Recently, the bank notified me that if the funds are not claimed or re-activated by December 15, 2024, they will be forfeited under their dormant account policy. Regrettably, I am unable to complete this process myself due to critical health circumstances. I am currently undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital and have been advised that my condition is terminal.  \n\nWhile I have donated a significant portion of my estate (including property and assets valued at ~$800,000 USD) to local charities and orphanages in Kenya and Kinshasa, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to international faith-based organizations, homeless shelters, and medical missions. My husband’s relatives, who are not aligned with our Christian values, have repeatedly attempted to seize control of these assets, leaving me unable to trust them with this responsibility.  \n\nWhy I Am Reaching Out to You:  \nThe bank requires a trustee to legally authorize the reactivation and transfer of these funds to verified charities. As a member of my church’s outreach network, your name was provided to me as a potential individual of integrity who may assist in this matter. If you are willing, I will instruct my attorney, Mr. Daniel Clarke (Clarke & Partners Legal Associates, Brussels), to liaise with you. He will provide:  \n1. A notarized authorization letter naming you as the temporary trustee.  \n2. Bank contact details and transfer protocols.  \n3. Documentation verifying the legitimacy of the account and my medical condition.  \n\nDue to my inability to speak (a result of my treatment) and concerns about family interference, all communication must remain via email. I sincerely apologize for the abrupt nature of this request and understand if you are unable to assist. However, time is of the essence to prevent the funds from being seized.  \n\nShould you agree to help, kindly respond to this email, and my attorney will promptly initiate the process. May God guide your decision.  \n\nWith gratitude,  \nSandra White  \nNairobi General Hospital, Room 214B  \n(Direct correspondence: sandra.white_trust@pmail.com)  \n\nNote: This request is bound by confidentiality. Discretion is appreciated to protect my family’s privacy.  \n\n---  \nThis email is fictional and intended solely for fraud awareness training.

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits many hallmarks of a scam. Although it uses emotional language and urgent circumstances to try to persuade you to act quickly, there are several red flags:\n\n• It comes unsolicited and asks you to participate in a financial process involving a large sum of money under unusual circumstances (a “dormant” account suddenly in jeopardy).\n\n• It appeals to your emotions by describing a terminal illness and urgent need, aiming to bypass your normal caution.\n\n• The request to act as a trustee and handle the funds is unconventional, especially coming from someone you’ve never met.\n\n• It insists that all communication take place via email and discourages direct contact or independent verification.\n\n• The email offers little in the way of verifiable details about the bank, the legal procedures, or the supposed attorney beyond a generic description.\n\nConsidering these points, the safest and most appropriate response is as follows:\n\n1. Do not reply, click on any links, download attachments, or provide any personal or financial information.  \n2. Mark the email as spam or junk and delete it from your inbox.  \n3. If you feel compelled or are curious about the claim—perhaps to report or educate others—research similar scams independently through reputable sources or contact your local law enforcement or consumer protection agency.  \n4. Be cautious: Legitimate financial matters or charitable trusts would be processed through secure, verifiable channels and typically not initiated through unsolicited emails.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay any attention to this email. It is most likely a scam designed to obtain your personal information or to involve you in fraudulent financial transactions. Stay safe by ignoring and deleting it, and consider reporting it to your email provider if you wish."

Red Flags in the Email:\n • The proposition involves a very large sum of money (in this case, $56 million) being offered for a relatively small involvement, which is a common tactic used in scams.\n • The sender claims to be a high-level government or financial official and asserts urgency and secrecy—both common elements in fraudulent messages.\n • Requesting your direct contact information to proceed further is a way for scammers to move into a more personal communication channel.\n • The overall tone, formatting, and content are typical of scams often referred to as “419” schemes (named after the related section of the Nigerian Criminal Code).\n\n2. Why You Should Be Cautious:\n • Legitimate government agencies and financial institutions do not operate in this manner. They never ask individuals to serve as intermediaries for transferring large amounts of money without proper legal channels and verification.\n • Responding or providing any personal details may expose you to further scams, phishing attempts, or even more elaborate fraud schemes.\n\n3. Appropriate Actions to Take:\n • Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email, and do not provide any personal, financial, or contact information.\n • Mark as Spam/Phishing: Use your email client’s option to mark the email as spam or phishing. This helps train your email service to recognize such messages in the future.\n • Delete the Email: Once marked, it’s best to delete the message to avoid any accidental engagement.\n • Report if Necessary: If you received it at a work email or if you’re particularly concerned, report it to your organization’s IT or security department. In some jurisdictions, you might also file a report with local law enforcement or a national cybersecurity agency.\n • Stay Informed: Be cautious of unsolicited emails offering lucrative financial deals or requests for personal information. Regularly update yourself on common phishing and scam techniques.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email. It is most likely a deceptive scam, and the safest course of action is to ignore and delete it."

This fund was allocated to me privately and must remain confidential to avoid implicating my family during my father’s transition from office.  \n\nI propose a partnership wherein you would act as both my spouse (to legitimize the transfer under marital provisions) and business investor. This arrangement would allow us to:  \n1. Legally transfer the funds to your account.  \n2. Establish a joint venture (e.g., real estate, agriculture, or manufacturing) in your country.  \n3. Formalize our marriage via a civil ceremony to expedite immigration processes.  \n\nFor your support, you will receive 20% of the total sum ($4.4 million), with an additional 10% allocated for administrative expenses. My family’s legal advisor, Mr. Kwame Osei, will handle all documentation to ensure compliance with international banking regulations.  \n\nConfidentiality is paramount. Please reply with your:  \n- Full name and residential address  \n- Direct contact number  \n- Preferred method of communication (email/phone)  \n\nOnce confirmed, I will travel to your country to finalize arrangements.  \n\nContact Details:  \n📧 Email: elizabeth.anan@mailservice.com  \n📞 Tel: +233 55 123 4567 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred)  \n\nI trust in your discretion and look forward to your urgent response.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMiss Elizabeth Anan  \nDaughter of H.E.

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am writing to seek your assistance in resolving a sensitive matter involving a dormant account under our institution’s management.  \n\nDuring a routine audit, we identified an inactive account holding a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four U.S. Dollars and Twenty-Two Cents). This account belonged to Mr. Piere Johnson, a German national and long-standing client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a vehicular accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin or legal beneficiaries—including collaboration with German authorities—no heirs have been identified. Under Benin Republic banking regulations, unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture to the state after a 7-year dormancy period.  \n\nTo prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating to formally designate you as the beneficiary of record. As the auditing authority, I am positioned to facilitate the necessary documentation to validate your claim as Mr. Johnson’s distant relative. Upon approval by our board, the funds will be transferred via SWIFT to your designated account through our affiliate, Citibank Europe PLC (Madrid Branch).  \n\nKey Details for Clarity:  \n- Account Holder: Piere Johnson (Deceased, German citizen, DOB: 15/03/1962)  \n- Funds Origin: Commodity trading dividends (2015–2019)  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Pre-approved SWIFT transaction (IBAN/BIC required)  \n- Legal Compliance: Full inheritance documentation will be provided to ensure regulatory adherence.  \n\nThis process requires no upfront financial commitment from you. I will oversee all administrative steps, including notarized affidavits and probate court filings. Please respond within 48 hours to confirm your willingness to proceed, as the statutory deadline for claims is 30 June 2024. For immediate discussion, I may be reached at +229 28 3063 45 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred) or via this secure email: myussuf@continentalbank-bj.com.  \n\nYour discretion in this matter is paramount.

        "one-round response": "This email has all the hallmarks of a scam—and you should be very cautious. It asks you to help claim a vast sum of money by representing a deceased relative, a setup that is routinely used in fraudulent “inheritance” scams. Here’s why you should be skeptical and what steps you can take:\n\n1. Suspicious Content and Urgency:  \n • The message contains elaborate details to appear authentic (name, account balance, even mentioning audits), but it’s designed to create urgency (requesting a response within 48 hours) so you don’t have time to think it through.  \n • The use of an inheritance story and reference to “next of kin” is a common strategy in scams to lure people into providing personal information or banking details.\n\n2. Unsolicited Contact:  \n • If you have no existing relationship with Continental Bank or any connection to a deceased relative as described, it is highly unlikely you’d legitimate be contacted in this manner.\n\n3. Request for Personal Details:  \n • They eventually want sensitive information, such as your bank account details (including IBAN/BIC), which is a red flag.\n\n4. Verifying the Sender:  \n • Although the email contains details (addresses, phone numbers, etc.), these can be easily spoofed or fabricated.  \n • Legitimate banks never ask someone to process funds or designate themselves as beneficiaries in this manner, especially through unsolicited emails.\n\nAppropriate Steps to Take:\n\n• Do NOT respond or engage with the sender.  \n• Do not provide any personal or financial information.  \n• Mark the email as spam/junk in your email client.  \n• Report the email to your local fraud prevention or consumer protection agency and, if applicable, to your bank’s fraud department.  \n• If you’re unsure, contact your bank directly using official contact details from their website (do not use the contact information provided in the suspicious email).\n\nBy treating this email with skepticism and not providing any information, you’ll protect yourself from potential scams. Keep your personal and financial data secure, and remember that any unsolicited email requesting sensitive information is best met with caution."

Asset Transfer: The security firm will re-register the boxes under your name as the designated beneficiary, enabling legal retrieval in your country.  \n2. Compensation: 30% (US$18,000,000) of the total sum will be your immediate compensation.  \n3.

        "one-round response": "This email is almost certainly a scam. It follows the well-known “Nigerian Prince” scam format—a type of fraudulent message that claims you can help transfer a large sum of money in exchange for a share of the funds. Here’s why you should be very cautious:\n\n1. The email uses formal, over-the-top language and an elaborate story about a large sum of money that is supposedly available for transfer. This story is designed to lure you into responding and sharing personal or financial details.\n\n2. It mentions transferring funds by re-registering deposit boxes in your name, which is a common tactic used by scammers to obtain access to your personal information and bank accounts.\n\n3. The promise of immediate large compensation is a red flag. Legitimate business offers do not come with such unrealistic terms, especially when asking for discreetness or confidentiality right off the bat.\n\n4. The email urges you to confirm your interest via an email address that doesn’t relate to any authentic, verifiable business contact.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle this situation is:\n\n• Do Not Respond: Do not engage with the sender or provide any personal or financial information.  \n• Mark as Spam: Delete or move the email to your spam/junk folder.  \n• Report if Necessary: If you’re concerned or if it appears to be part of a wider scam operation, report it to your email provider or your local cybersecurity authority.\n\nIn summary, you should ignore and delete this email. It’s best not to pay any attention to it since it clearly exhibits the classic signs of a scam."

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a time-sensitive matter requiring international collaboration.  \n\nIn June 1998, following the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha, authorities intercepted six diplomatic trunks containing foreign currencies totaling $197,570,000 during an attempted departure by his associates. As part of the investigative team, I officially declared five trunks to the Federal Government. The sixth trunk, containing $30,000,000, was retained under my supervision to prevent its misuse during the heightened scrutiny of Abacha’s offshore assets, widely reported by outlets such as The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and the BBC.  \n\nTo secure these funds, the trunk was deposited with SecureLogistics Nigeria Ltd., a licensed security firm, under the classification “Precious Stones & Jewelry” to avoid suspicion. With the situation now stabilized, my two trusted colleagues and I seek to relocate this trunk abroad via diplomatic channels, as Nigerian civil service regulations prohibit officials from holding foreign accounts or investments.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1.

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. I am a Dubai-based oil trader currently undergoing treatment for late-stage pancreatic cancer. My physicians estimate I have only weeks remaining.  \n\nIn light of my prognosis, I am prioritizing the allocation of a dormant asset: $35 million USD held in a secure private vault with Al-Mansoori Security Services (Dubai branch) since 2003. This fund was earmarked for disaster relief but remained untouched due to my previous focus on business.  \n\nRecent events have compelled me to act. Earlier this year, I entrusted family members to disburse a separate charitable sum through a Saudi Arabian bank account. Regrettably, they diverted the funds for personal use. This breach of trust necessitates external assistance to ensure the $35 million reaches its intended recipients: verified NGOs supporting tsunami recovery efforts in Southeast Asia and hurricane relief programs in the Gulf Coast (USA).  \n\nYour Role:  \n1. Authorize you as my fiduciary agent to retrieve the deposit from Al-Mansoori Security Services.  \n2. Oversee distribution to pre-vetted organizations (documentation available upon engagement).  \n3. Retain 10% ($3.5M) for administrative costs and time compensation.  \n\nRequired for Legal Processing:  \n- Full name, residential address, and occupation  \n- Direct contact number (e.g., +971-4-910-4953 format)  \n- Government-issued ID copy (scanned) for notarized authorization  \n\nI have instructed my legal advisor, Mr. Faisal Al-Haddad (f.alhaddad@almansoorilegal.ae | Office: +971-4-223-8801), to expedite paperwork upon your confirmation.  \n\nWhile I understand the unusual nature of this request, time constraints prevent conventional vetting.

Why you should not pay attention:\n • Since you don’t have any prior contact or connection with the sender or the entities mentioned (Al-Mansoori Security Services, Mr. Faisal Al-Haddad, etc.), it’s almost certainly a fraudulent attempt to obtain your personal information or possibly involve you in a money laundering scheme.\n • Responding or providing your personal details could expose you to identity theft and other scams.\n\n3. What you should do:\n • Do not reply to the email or provide any personal details.\n • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.\n • Report the scam to your local authorities or appropriate cybercrime unit. For example, in many countries there are consumer protection agencies or fraud reporting services where you can forward such emails.\n • If you’re unsure, you might consult with a trusted IT or cybersecurity professional for additional guidance.\n\nIn summary, this email is not legitimate, and the best course of action is to ignore and delete it. Always be cautious with unsolicited emails, especially those requesting personal data or offering financial windfalls."

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. I apologize for the abrupt nature of this request, but I believe your discretion and goodwill could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother’s estate.  \n\nMy mother, Ms. Helen Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of Kem Industries, a manufacturing firm based in Johannesburg. Tragically, her business partner, Mr. Philip Brown, was implicated in her death (ruled as poisoning by authorities) and subsequently arrested. Before her passing, my mother secured a $9.8 million deposit with Standard Continental Bank to procure machinery for a new subsidiary. The bank holds strict instructions to transfer these funds only to a designated overseas supplier account—a detail now complicated by her death.  \n\nDespite being her sole heir, my family has disowned me due to disputes over her estate. They have revoked my access to her properties and frozen my financial resources. During a review of her documents, I discovered this dormant account. The bank cannot release the funds without proof of a valid supplier account, and disclosing her death would risk forfeiting the deposit entirely under the bank’s compliance policies.  \n\nHere’s how you can assist:  \n1. Provide a foreign bank account (personal or corporate) to be listed as the “supplier” recipient.  \n2. Coordinate discreetly to transfer 85% of the funds to me (15% commission is yours) once released.  \n3. Advise on relocation options, as my safety here is compromised.  \n\nI have consulted a legal advisor to ensure this process complies with banking regulations, provided the transfer is framed as fulfilling my mother’s original intent. Confidentiality is paramount—the bank must not learn of her passing until the transaction concludes.  \n\nIf willing to proceed, kindly reply with your contact number and a suitable time to discuss. You may reach me at +27 76 418 3291 or joy.kem@protonmail.com.  \n\nThank you for considering this urgent appeal. Your compassion could safeguard my future.  \n\nKind regards,  \nJoy Kem  \nJohannesburg, South Africa  \n---  \nNote: This email is formatted to simulate a plausible real-world scenario for training purposes.

Here are some key red flags:\n\n• It involves an unexpected inheritance or large sum of money being transferred under urgent, “secretive” conditions.  \n• It requests your assistance with providing your bank account details and offers a commission, which is typical of many fraud schemes.  \n• The language and situation are crafted to generate sympathy and prompt a quick response without proper due diligence.  \n• The sender intends to keep the bank in the dark regarding important facts, signaling a breach of normal transparency and legal procedures.\n\nThe appropriate course of action is as follows:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Refrain from replying to the email. Do not share any personal or financial information.\n\n2. Mark It as Spam/Phishing: Use your email provider’s tools to mark the email as spam or phishing. This also helps your provider filter similar emails in the future.\n\n3.

Report It: Consider reporting the email to your local or national cybersecurity or fraud prevention agency if you want to help prevent others from being targeted.\n\n5. Stay Informed: Familiarize yourself with common tactics used in scams and phishing emails. If an email asks for sensitive details or presents an unusually urgent request for financial transactions, it is best to exercise caution.\n\nLastly, if you’re ever unsure about the legitimacy of an email or message, it’s a good idea to seek advice from someone you trust, such as a friend, colleague, or professional advisor who is knowledgeable about scams.\n\nIn conclusion, you don’t need to pay attention to this email.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your discretion and cooperation.  \n\nDuring the recent International Trade Summit in Johannesburg, your professional profile was recommended to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who noted your expertise in cross-border financial transactions. After thorough verification of your credentials, I believe you are well-suited to assist in finalizing an outstanding contractual matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2022, my department oversaw a mining infrastructure project managed by a foreign contractor. Due to administrative adjustments during the project’s execution, an over-invoiced balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) remains unallocated. This surplus has received provisional approval for repatriation to a non-domestic account, pending submission of valid offshore banking details.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs civil servants, we are legally restricted from holding foreign accounts. We seek a reputable international partner to act as the beneficiary for this transfer. Upon confirmation of your participation, our legal team will file a “Transfer of Rights” application with the Ministry of Justice to designate your entity as the successor to the original contractor.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Your Share: 25% (USD 2,625,000) for facilitating the transfer.  \n- Our Share: 70% retained for departmental reallocation.  \n- Remaining 5%: Covers administrative fees, including notarization and banking charges.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant under South African Treasury Regulation 16.4.3 (Offshore Remittances for Contractual Obligations). All documentation will be processed through First National Bank of South Africa (FNB) to ensure legitimacy.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest via email or phone (+27 72 555 0123) by [Date: 3 days from current].  \n2. Provide your full banking details (IBAN/SWIFT) and a copy of valid government-issued ID for due diligence.  \n3. Await delivery of the Ministry of Justice approval notice within 7 business days.  \n\nConfidentiality:  \nThis matter is classified under Section 14(1) of the Promotion of Access to Information Act. Disclosure would jeopardize both the transaction and my position. Kindly refrain from discussing this via unsecured channels.  \n\nI trust in your professionalism to expedite this mutually beneficial arrangement.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nBongies Zulu  \nSenior Financial Officer  \nDepartment of Mining & Natural Resources  \nCape Town, South Africa  \nTel: +27 72 555 0123  \nEmail: b.zulu@dmnr.gov.za  \n\nNote: This communication is intended solely for the addressed recipient.

        "one-round response": "This email has many hallmark signs of a scam and should be treated with extreme caution. Here are several points and recommended steps:\n\n1. Red Flags in the Email:\n • The email comes unsolicited from someone claiming to be from a government department.\n • It involves a large sum of money and an urgent request to provide sensitive financial details.\n • The language and structure are similar to known advance-fee or \"419\" scams.\n • The use of confidentiality clauses and urgency are common tactics to pressure you into acting without proper verification.\n\n2. Why You Should Be Cautious:\n • Legitimate government agencies or departments typically do not contact individuals via email to offer large sums or request personal banking information.\n • The described process (requiring you to act as a beneficiary with foreign bank details) is highly unusual and often used to scam unsuspecting individuals out of personal information or money.\n • The provided contact details and legal references might be falsified or intended to add a veneer of legitimacy.\n\n3. Recommended Actions:\n • Do not reply to the email or provide any personal or financial information.\n • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.\n • If you’re concerned or curious, verify the legitimacy independently by contacting the official South African Department of Mining & Natural Resources using verified contact details from their official website—not the ones given in the email.\n • Report the email to your email provider’s fraud and phishing team.\n • Consider reporting the incident to your local law enforcement or a national cybercrime support organization if you believe you’ve been targeted.\n\nRemember, when you receive unrequested proposals with promises of large sums of money in exchange for upfront actions or sensitive information, it is best to stay cautious and validate their authenticity through official channels."

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch by the late Engr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  \n\nBackground of the Matter:  \nIn August 1996, Engr. Lee Seunghyo opened a 12-month fixed deposit account valued at USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars). Upon maturity in 1997, routine notifications were dispatched to his registered address but received no response. Subsequent investigations revealed that Engr. Lee tragically perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam (August 1997). Further inquiries confirmed he died intestate (without a will) and left no declared next of kin or beneficiaries in his bank records or NNPC employment documents.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed funds exceeding 10 years are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. However, as the account’s custodian, I have secured a Court Order of Mandamus (Case Ref: FHC/L/CP/342/2024) to identify a lawful beneficiary before the impending deadline of October 31, 2024.  \n\nProposal for Collaboration:  \nTo prevent these funds from reverting to government custody, I propose nominating you as the deceased’s next of kin. As a foreign national, you qualify to claim the deposit, as local regulations prohibit direct transfers to Nigerian accounts for dormant USD holdings.  \n\nRequired Steps:  \n1. Provide the following details to initiate legal documentation:  \n   - Full Name & Residential Address  \n   - Date of Birth & Occupation  \n   - Contact Telephone Number (for verification)  \n\n2. Our retained legal team, Adeoye & Associates Legal Practitioners, will draft a notarized affidavit and probate documents to establish your status as the beneficiary.  \n\n3. Funds will be transferred to your designated offshore account upon approval.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (facilitation and risk coverage)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (pre-deducted prior to disbursement)  \n\nConfidentiality & Assurance:  \nThis transaction is protected under attorney-client privilege. My position as Credit Manager ensures all processes comply with internal protocols. Strict discretion is required to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nAct Now:  \nKindly respond within 72 hours to secure your slot. Delays risk forfeiture of the funds.  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: dobidima@firsttrustbankng.com  \n- Office Line: +234 1 904 7563 (Ext. 112)  \n- Bank Address: FirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC, 24 Marina Road, Lagos Island, Lagos.  \n\nYour prompt attention to this mutually beneficial opportunity is appreciated.  \n\nYours faithfully,  \nMr. Donald Ofu Obidima  \nCredit Control Manager  \nFirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC  \nConfidentiality Note: This communication is intended solely for the addressee.

        "one-round response": "This email bears all the hallmarks of a scam. Here’s why you should be extremely cautious and what you should do:\n\n1. It follows the typical pattern of an advance-fee or fraud scam—often called a “419” scam—by promising a huge amount of money in exchange for your personal information and cooperation.  \n2. The narrative is contrived and inconsistent when you scrutinize the details (e.g., a fixed deposit account from 1996, a beneficiary who never existed, and claims involving international banks).  \n3. Legitimate banks, lawyers, or government agencies do not contact unsuspecting individuals out of the blue with such proposals, nor do they require you to provide private details as a condition for processing funds.  \n4. The email pressures you to act quickly (within 72 hours), which is another classic scam tactic to create a sense of urgency and prevent you from thoroughly checking the legitimacy of the claim.\n\nTo protect yourself, here’s the appropriate course of action:\n\n• Do Not Respond: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal or financial information.  \n• Do Not Click on Links or Download Attachments: There could be malicious links or files intended to compromise your computer or steal your information.  \n• Mark as Spam/Junk: Use your email provider’s tools to mark the message as spam so similar messages are filtered out in the future.  \n• Report the Scam: If you wish, you can report the email to your country’s fraud or cybercrime authorities. For example, in the United States, you can report such scams to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).  \n• Stay Informed: Educate yourself more about common scams. Many reputable organizations, such as your local consumer protection agency or government websites, have resources that list common red flags.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to pay attention to this email. The safest action is to ignore and delete it. Stay vigilant and protect your personal information from potential scams."

        "generated text": "\n\nSubject: Request for Confidential Assistance in Securing Family Funds  \n\nDear [Recipient's Name],  \n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Lydia Johnson, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. My late husband, Major Stephen Johnson, served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia during his administration. Following the president’s exile and the escalation of political unrest in Monrovia, my family has faced severe hardship.  \n\nTragically, my husband was killed by armed rebels during a targeted attack six months ago. Fearing for our safety, I fled Monrovia with my son David (23) and four daughters. With the aid of a security contact, we crossed the border into Dakar, Senegal, where we currently reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly deposited US$7 million with a private financial institution here in Dakar (verified as Banque de Sécurité Financière - Dakar). Due to my deteriorating health (I suffer from advanced diabetes and hypertension) and the instability in Senegal’s border regions, I urgently seek a trustworthy partner abroad to facilitate the transfer and safekeeping of these funds. This sum represents my family’s sole remaining asset, as our properties in Liberia were destroyed by rebel forces.  \n\nYour role would involve acting as a designated beneficiary to receive the funds into a secure account in your country. A legal representative here in Dakar will handle all documentation and logistics. For your assistance, you would retain 15% of the total amount, with the remainder allocated to my family’s resettlement and medical care.  \n\nDue to security concerns, I must emphasize the confidentiality of this request. You may contact me directly at lydia.johnson.assist@gmail.com or through my legal advisor, Mr. Amadou Diallo, at +221 77 854 3291 (Senegal).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this appeal and would gladly provide additional verification through secure channels. Your discretion is paramount, as my children’s safety depends on swift resolution.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nDakar, Senegal  \n\nNote: All identifiers, including bank names and contacts, are fabricated for training purposes and do not represent real entities or individuals.",

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits many of the classic signs of a scam—often referred to as an \"advance-fee scam\" or \"419 scam.\" Here are some key reasons why you should be very cautious:\n\n• Unsolicited Request: The email comes out of the blue and asks for your assistance in handling a large sum of money using your personal bank account, which is a common tactic used in scams.\n\n• Emotional and Urgent Tone: The message uses distressing personal details (family tragedy, health issues, political unrest) to create urgency and lower your guard.\n\n• Promised Fee for Assistance: Offering you 15% of the funds as compensation is another red flag. In scams like this, once you engage, they may ask you for personal details, bank information, or even money to cover processing fees.\n\n• Confidentiality and Secrecy: The sender emphasizes secrecy and warns against discussing the matter with others, a classic tactic to isolate you from advice or assistance.\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or engage with the sender. Engaging with scammers can lead to further fraudulent communications or more sophisticated scams.\n\n2. Do Not Share Personal Information: Never provide any personal, financial, or contact information in response to such requests.\n\n3. Mark the Email as Spam: Use your email provider’s tools to mark the message as spam or junk. This can help train filtering systems and protect you from future scams.\n\n4. Report It: If you’re in the U.S., you might report such fraudulent emails to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at www.ftc.gov/complaint. Other countries will have their own consumer protection agencies or cybercrime reporting centers.\n\n5. Delete the Email: Once you’ve reported it, you can delete the email to avoid accidental interaction later.\n\n6. Be Cautious with Unsolicited Messages: Scammers often use persuasive stories and urgent language—you should always be cautious when you receive unexpected messages, especially those involving financial matters.\n\nBy following these steps, you’ll be protecting your personal information and avoiding potential scams. Always take a moment to verify the legitimacy of any unexpected financial request before taking any action."

I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer.

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing under deeply personal and urgent circumstances. I apologize for reaching out unprompted, but I believe your expertise could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother’s estate.  \n\nBackground:  \nMy mother, Ms. Eliza Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of KemCo Industries, a venture she co-founded with a business partner, Mr. Philip Brown. Tragically, her death was ruled a poisoning, and Mr. Brown was arrested shortly afterward. Though he denied involvement, he coerced my uncles (my mother’s brothers) into signing agreements that excluded me from her company. I was later removed entirely for opposing their legal counsel, who I suspect colluded in her death.  \n\nRecently, while reviewing her financial records, I discovered a dormant account at First Continental Trust Bank (UK) containing $9,800,000. Per her deposit agreement, these funds were earmarked to purchase machinery for a new subsidiary. However, the bank cannot release the money without proof of a valid “customer account” linked to the intended machinery supplier.  \n\nThe Situation:  \nMy relatives have disowned me, seized her property, and threatened my safety. I cannot approach the bank directly, as they believe my mother is still alive (I claimed she is hospitalized to maintain her authority). To access the funds, I urgently need:  \n\n1. A Corporate Bank Account: You would act as the overseas supplier, allowing the bank to transfer the $9.8 million into an account under your name or business.  \n2. Relocation Support: Assistance arranging safe passage from Lagos to your country once the transfer is complete.  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 15% of the total amount ($1,470,000) for your partnership.  \n\nWhy Trust Me?  \nI am my mother’s only child (born when she was 18), and my father abandoned us before my birth. At 20, I have no family, resources, or legal recourse here. Attached are redacted copies of the bank agreement and my mother’s death certificate for verification.  \n\nThis request is confidential. If you are willing to help, please reply to joy.kem.assist@gmail.com or call +44 77 5348 1921 by October 15th. I will provide full documentation and coordinate next steps promptly.  \n\nThank you for considering this appeal. Your discretion and compassion could save my life and honor my mother’s legacy.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMiss Joy Kem  \n(On behalf of the Kem Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: All documentation will be verified through a trusted third-party legal advisor to ensure mutual security.

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n• Suspicious Storyline: The email mixes personal tragedy with an urgent financial opportunity, a common tactic used by scammers to trigger an emotional response and rush a decision.\n\n• Unsolicited Request for Assistance: Legitimate financial institutions or legal matters rarely reach out unsolicited, especially with complex schemes involving international transfers.\n\n• Request to Act as a Front: The sender’s ask for you to provide a corporate bank account and assist with relocation is typical of scams where the scammer wants you to be complicit in money laundering or fraudulent activity.\n\n• Unverifiable Claims: Personal and business details, such as the death certificate or bank documents, often come with redactions or are simply fabricated in such scams.\n\n• Time Pressure and Promised Compensation: Scammers frequently create urgency (\"reply by October 15th\") and promise a significant reward to lure victims into making rushed decisions.\n\nWhat You Should Do:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Do not provide any personal information or financial details, and do not click on any attachments or links if there are any.\n\n2. Mark as Junk/Spam: Report the email as spam/phishing to your email provider. This helps improve filters and prevents further similar attempts.\n\n3. Inform Your IT/Security Team: If this email came to your work or personal email account, consider informing your IT or security team so they can take additional precautions if needed.\n\n4. Exercise Caution: Always verify unsolicited offers or messages that involve transferring funds, legal issues, or relocation. A quick independent check (using trusted sources rather than the information given in the email) can save you from scams.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to pay attention to this email other than for awareness, and it is best to ignore and delete it. Remaining cautious and reporting it to the appropriate authorities (such as your email provider or a local consumer protection agency) will help protect you and possibly others."

I am writing to you with utmost urgency and discretion, as I believe your reputation aligns with the integrity this matter demands.  \n\nAs you may be aware, Liberia’s political instability under Charles Taylor’s regime (1997–2003) led to widespread persecution.

        "one-round response": "This email is almost certainly a scam and should be disregarded. It displays several typical red flags used in fraud and phishing schemes:\n\n1. Unexpected Contact: Legitimate banks or financial institutions do not usually reach out out of the blue via email to offer large sums of money or to request personal documents.\n\n2. High Monetary Value & Urgency: The offer of a substantial amount ($87.6 million USD) combined with urgent deadlines (15 November and 30 November) is a common tactic used to pressure victims into acting hastily without verification.\n\n3. Request for Personal Information: The email asks for copies of government-issued IDs and the completion of official forms. Legitimate institutions rarely require such sensitive information over unsecured or unverified channels.\n\n4. Unusual Email Domain and Contact Details: The email address (mdura@financialtrustbank-bf.com) and office locations may not correspond with any known legitimate bank. It’s advisable to verify via official channels, but if you can’t confirm independently, treat it with extreme caution.\n\n5. Uncommon Procedures and Legal Claims: References to articles, legal fees deducted post-transfer, and involvement of supposed attorney services are frequent in scams to make the communication sound credible.\n\nRecommended Actions:\n\n• Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal, financial, or identification details.\n\n• Do Not Click Attachments: Avoid opening any attachments or following any links as they might contain malware or further phishing attempts.\n\n• Mark as Spam/Phishing: Report the email as spam or phishing to your email provider to help filter similar messages in the future.\n\n• Inform Your IT/Security Team: If you received this email on a work account, notify your IT or cybersecurity department immediately.\n\n• Verify Independently: If you are ever in doubt about an email’s authenticity, contact the official institution directly using verified contact information from their official website—not the contact details provided in the suspicious email.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email beyond recognizing it as a scam. Stay cautious, and always be skeptical of unsolicited offers that promise large gains while asking for personal information."

My name is Mrs. Jewel Taylor, wife of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. As you may be aware, my husband has resided in Nigeria under political asylum since 2003, following the instability in Liberia. Recent developments by the United Nations and current Liberian authorities have necessitated his potential repatriation for judicial proceedings.  \n\nDue to heightened scrutiny, certain financial assets linked to my family have been restricted by the interim government. Among these is a trust holding $30,270,000.00 (thirty million two hundred and seventy thousand US dollars), originally designated for humanitarian projects. This account is now at risk of seizure, despite its legitimate origins.  \n\nGiven these circumstances, I seek your discretion to act as an intermediary to safeguard these funds. The process would involve transferring the amount temporarily to a secure offshore account under your name, after which my legal team will reclaim it through diplomatic channels. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total sum as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to international compliance standards, and my family’s legal advisors will oversee every step to ensure legality. Due to confidentiality concerns, I kindly request you reply directly to my private email: jeandcine@yahoo.co.uk, or contact me via secure line at +231 88 654 3219 (Monrovia).  \n\nTime is of the essence, as the government intends to finalize asset forfeiture within 10 business days. Your discretion in this sensitive matter is deeply valued.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Jewel Taylor  \nSpouse of H.E. Charles Ghankay Taylor  \nFormer President, Republic of Liberia  \n——  \nThis communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient. Unauthorized sharing is prohibited.",

        "one-round response": "This email shows several red flags that strongly indicate it is a scam:\n\n• Unsolicited Message from a “Stranger”: The email is unexpected and comes from an unknown source, supposedly linked to a high-profile individual. Authentic communications from government officials or legal representatives typically follow proper channels.\n\n• High Sum and Urgency: The offer involves a very large sum of money with a short deadline and promises a hefty commission (20%). Scammers often use urgency and attractive rewards to manipulate recipients into acting without fully thinking.\n\n• Unverified Claims and Poor Credibility: The sender’s information (such as the association with former Liberian President Charles Taylor) is dubious, and the explanation provided is vague and inconsistent with how legitimate financial or legal matters are managed.\n\n• Request for Intermediary Role: Being asked to transfer funds to your own account is a common tactic in advance fee fraud and other scams. In legitimate financial or legal cases, you would never be approached in this manner.\n\nWhat You Should Do:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or click on any links or provide any personal or financial information.\n\n2. Mark as Spam or Junk: Use your email client’s options to mark the email as spam or junk. This helps your email provider filter similar messages in the future.\n\n3. Report the Scam: Consider reporting the email to your email provider or local consumer protection agency. You may also want to file a report with local law enforcement if you are concerned.\n\n4. Maintain Caution: Be cautious of any future unsolicited emails or messages that promise large sums of money. Scammers often target unsuspecting individuals with enticing financial offers.\n\n5. Consider Additional Security Measures: If you have interacted with the email (for instance, if you clicked on links or provided any information), you may want to run a full virus scan on your computer or contact your service provider for further advice.\n\nIn summary, you don’t need to pay attention to this email beyond making sure it is properly dealt with (i.e., by marking it as spam or reporting it). It seems highly likely to be a scam, so your best course of action is simply to delete it and remain cautious of similar messages in the future."

I write to you under strict confidentiality to propose a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding an unclaimed account in our records.  \n\nIn 2000, Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska, perished alongside his family in the tragic Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash (January 31, 2000). Documentation confirming this event is publicly available via the [CNN Archives](http://edition.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.crash/). Mr. Thompson maintained a dormant account (No. 14-2558-5976) with a balance of USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  \n\nPer Burkina Faso banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after four years. Despite repeated efforts to locate next-of-kin, no claimants have surfaced. As a foreign national, Mr. Thompson’s account requires a non-Burkinabé beneficiary to avoid forfeiture.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next-of-kin to facilitate the transfer.  \n2. I will furnish verified documentation to legitimize your claim.  \n3. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% (USD 3,750,000.00) to you.  \n   - 5% allocated for administrative fees (taxes, legal, and transfer costs).  \n   - 65% retained by myself to secure internal approvals.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with BOA’s internal protocols. Strict confidentiality is paramount to avoid scrutiny.

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits many of the classic hallmarks of a scam, often known as an “advance-fee fraud” or “419 scam.” Here are some points to consider and recommendations for handling it:\n\n1. Suspicious claims and urgency: Scammers often create a sense of urgency and secrecy (requiring you to act quickly under “strict confidentiality”). Genuine financial institutions do not conduct business in this manner.\n\n2. Unverified sender and odd details: The email references a substantial sum from a deceased individual tied to a tragic incident, an unlikely scenario for a legitimate bank. The details, including the process and bank regulation specifics, don’t align with standard practices.\n\n3. Unusual disbursement proposal: Splitting the funds in a way where you receive 30% and the sender claims 65% is a tactic designed to prompt engagement. Legitimate processes for handling estates or unclaimed funds would involve legal protocols, transparency, and scrutiny from multiple authorities.\n\n4. Taking action:  \n   • Do not reply to the email or provide any personal or financial information.  \n   • Do not click on any links or open attachments that may be included in future communications.  \n   • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.  \n   • If you’re curious or think it might be a real issue, independently contact your bank or a trusted legal advisor. Use official contact information from their verified website, not anything provided in the suspicious email.\n\n5. Reporting: Consider reporting the email to local fraud or law enforcement authorities and to your email provider. In many countries, there are agencies or online portals dedicated to reporting scam or phishing attempts.\n\nIn summary, there’s no need to pay attention to this email—it’s best to treat it as a scam—and the appropriate way to handle it is to delete it without engaging, mark it as spam, and report it if necessary."

My name is Martin Chime, and I serve as a senior account manager at this branch. Your contact was discreetly recommended by a trusted intermediary within the Lagos Chamber of Commerce due to your international residency status, which aligns with the requirements of this matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national, Mr. Kemal Aydin (a Turkish contractor residing in Lagos), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million. Mr. Aydin tragically passed away in a road accident later that year, and no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds in the intervening four years. Under Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the government if unclaimed.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs a bank employee, I am ethically obligated to resolve such cases transparently. However, given the lack of claimants, my team (including two senior colleagues) has identified a lawful pathway to transfer these funds to a qualified beneficiary. We propose to formally designate you as Mr. Aydin’s distant relative and executor of his estate. Your role would involve providing basic documentation (e.g., passport, proof of address) to validate this claim. All internal bank approvals and probate processes have been prearranged to ensure swift execution.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Timeline: 10 business days to finalize documentation and release funds.  \n- Compensation: 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million) for your participation.  \n- Confidentiality: Communication will occur exclusively via secure channels until completion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, confirm your interest by replying to this email or contacting me directly at +234 809 755 4321 (WhatsApp/SMS) or mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com. Upon your confirmation, I will forward a detailed procedural guide, including templates for required affidavits and notarized forms. Our legal team will oversee all filings to ensure compliance with Nigerian probate law.  \n\nThis opportunity is time-sensitive, as regulatory audits of dormant accounts are scheduled in the coming weeks. Rest assured, the process is entirely legal and structured to avoid future disputes.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nBest regards,  \nMartin Chime  \nSenior Account Manager  \nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA), Ilupeju Branch  \nLagos, Nigeria  \nTel: +234 809 755 4321 | Email: mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers.

        "generated text": "\n\nSubject: Urgent Confidential Request for Trusted Assistance  \n\nDear Mr. Jonathan Keller,  \n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your assistance in securing a financial legacy left by my late husband.  \n\nPrior to his passing, General Abacha established a USD 25 million deposit with a licensed security firm in Accra, Ghana, designated solely for my family’s welfare. Due to ongoing investigations by the Nigerian government and international entities—spearheaded by Swiss lawyer Enrico Monfrini—into my late husband’s estate, we have been unable to access these funds directly. As reported by The Guardian on March 15, 2000, significant assets linked to our family have been frozen or seized, leaving this deposit as our last recourse.  \n\nOur family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has safeguarded my husband’s final will, which authorizes the release of these funds to a designated foreign trustee. Due to travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of our associates, we require a discreet third party to act as the beneficiary of record. Your role would involve facilitating the transfer of the funds to a secure offshore account under your name, after which the entirety of the sum would be redirected to our family’s custody.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- The deposit is held at Ghana Trust Securities Ltd., with valid Certificates of Deposit and a Notarized Power of Attorney prepared for your review.  \n- Barrister Musa will meet you in Accra to finalize documentation and accompany you to the depository.  \n- For security, all correspondence must occur via his secure email: tony.musalaw@abachalawfirm.com.ng or phone: +233 55 712 3098 (Ghana office).  \n\nYour Commitment:  \n1. Reply promptly with your full contact details (phone/fax) to enable direct coordination.  \n2. Maintain absolute confidentiality to avoid jeopardizing the process.  \n3. Upon successful transfer, you will receive USD 1.2 million (5% of the total) as compensation.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the depository requires proof of beneficiary status within 21 days to avoid forfeiture. I emphasize that this transaction is lawful and has been structured by our legal team, including consultation with the late Johnnie Cochran, to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nYour discretion and goodwill are paramount. Kindly confirm your willingness to assist by replying to Barrister Musa directly.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Maryam Abacha  \nOn behalf of the Abacha Family Estate  \n\n---  \nNote: This email simulates a real-world scam for training purposes.

Red flags in the email:\n • Unsolicited contact from an unknown party asking for personal involvement in transferring large sums of money.\n • Requesting your personal details, which could be misused for identity theft.\n • Urgency and a short deadline meant to pressure you into acting without proper consideration.\n • References to high-profile figures and legal experts to add credibility.\n • A promise of a substantial reward if you participate.\n\n2. What you should do:\n • Do not respond to the email. Engaging with the sender may result in further phishing attempts or other scams.\n • Do not share any personal or financial information.\n • Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client.\n • If you accidentally clicked on any links or attachments, run a comprehensive antivirus/malware scan on your device.\n • You may consider reporting the email to your email provider or local authorities who handle online fraud or cybercrime.\n\n3.

        "one-round response": "This email shows several red flags that are common in scams, particularly those involving unsolicited “inheritance” or “unclaimed funds.” Here are some points to consider and recommendations on how to proceed:\n\n1. Red Flags to Note:\n • Unsolicited Offer: You weren’t expecting any inheritance or business relationship, yet the email claims you have been nominated as a beneficiary.\n • Unbelievable Sum: The amount mentioned (USD 22,600,000.00) is extraordinarily high and is a common tactic to lure recipients.\n • Urgent Deadline: Scams often create a false sense of urgency (“30-day grace period”) to pressure you into acting before you have time to think.\n • Request for Personal/Bank Information: The email asks for detailed personal and banking data so that funds can be transferred, which is a typical strategy used by fraudsters.\n • Inconsistent Details: The email contains unusual administrative arrangements (e.g., a beneficiary percentage distribution where you receive 30% and BOA retains 60% for “charitable initiatives”), which is not typical for legitimate bank procedures.\n\n2. What to Do:\n • Do Not Respond: Unless you can independently verify the legitimacy of the correspondence, it is safer not to reply.\n • Do Not Provide Personal or Financial Information: Avoid sharing any details like your bank account, national ID, or other sensitive data.\n • Verify Independently: If you are still unsure about the email’s legitimacy, contact your bank directly or reach out to official customer service channels—not using the details provided in the email—to ask if they have any record of such communications.\n • Report the Email: Consider reporting this as potential fraud or phishing to your email provider and, if you believe it to be part of a larger scam, to local law enforcement or a relevant consumer protection agency.\n • Delete the Email: After you have reported it, it is best to delete the email so that you’re not tempted to interact further with it.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nGiven the numerous warning signs, it’s highly likely that this is a scam. Be cautious, and do not engage with or provide any further information to the sender. Protect your personal and financial security by verifying any unexpected messages through independent, trusted channels before taking action.\n\nIf you’re ever in doubt about an unexpected email involving money, legal claims, or personal information, it’s always best to err on the side of caution and consult with professionals or trusted institutions before proceeding."

My name is Victoria Karegaye, a 22-year-old from Kigali, Rwanda. I am writing to you under extraordinary circumstances and apologize for the sudden nature of this request.  \n\nMy late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the Managing Director of Royal Diamond Corporation in Kigali. Tragically, he and my mother were killed during the civil unrest in 2018, and our family’s assets were seized or destroyed. Before his passing, he secured a deposit certificate valued at $4.2 million USD under my name at the Bank of Kigali (Ref: BK-DC-4892).  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to the funds. However, due to my current refugee status (UNHCR Case ID: RW-1129-45M), Rwandan monetary policy prohibits me from directly accessing the account. The Central Bank of Rwanda requires a foreign national to act as a trustee to finalize the transfer.  \n\nI have been advised by my legal representative, Mr. Jean-Claude Niyomugabo (Bar License: RBA-6631), to identify a trustworthy individual abroad to facilitate this process. Your contact was recommended through a private directory, and I humbly ask if you would consider assisting me.  \n\nUpon your agreement:  \n1. I will provide notarized documents confirming my identity, the deposit certificate, and legal affidavits.  \n2. The Bank of Kigali will coordinate directly with you to process the transfer.  \n3. You will retain 15% of the total sum ($630,000 USD) as compensation.  \n\nTime is critical, as the bank will revoke the claim if unresolved within 14 business days. Please reply to v.karegaye.assist@zohomail.rw or call +250 7912 34891 (WhatsApp/Signal) at your earliest convenience.  \n\nThank you for your understanding.

Unsolicited request from an unknown sender: The email comes unexpectedly and establishes an emotional story with urgent need, which is a common tactic among scams.\n\n2. Request to use you as a “trustworthy individual”: Scammers often ask for someone to act as a middleman or trustee. The story is contrived with details (inheritance, funds transfer, refugee status, etc.) to make it seem urgent and lucrative.\n\n3. Promising an unusually high compensation: Offering 15% of $4.2 million (i.e., $630,000) for minimal effort is a red flag that the proposed deal is too good to be true.\n\n4. Pressure of time constraints: Insisting that you respond within a short time frame is designed to pressure you to act without proper due diligence.\n\n5. Unverified contact details and document claims: While they mention notarized documents and legal representatives, scammers often provide fake references. Verifying these details independently is nearly impossible unless you already have a trusted connection with the referenced institution.\n\nBased on these red flags, you should not engage with the email. Here is the recommended course of action:\n\n• Do not respond or click any links, provide any personal information, or forward any of your personal details.  \n• Mark the email as spam or junk and delete it.  \n• If you feel uneasy and want to verify the claims, independently contact the institution or bank mentioned (using official contact details from their legitimate website, not those provided in the email) to check if there is any truth to the message.  \n• Consider reporting the email to your local consumer protection or fraud reporting agency.\n\nIn summary, this email is most likely a scam.

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring urgent cooperation.  \n\nFollowing the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha on June 8, 1998, a routine customs inspection uncovered six diplomatic trunks aboard a chartered flight bound for Saudi Arabia. These trunks contained foreign currency totaling $197,570,000.00 USD. Per protocol, five trunks were declared to the government, while one containing $30,000,000.00 USD was discreetly secured to avoid public scrutiny during ongoing investigations into misappropriated state funds.  \n\nAs reported by The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and The London Times (July 12, 1998), international audits revealed billions linked to Abacha’s associates. To mitigate risks, the remaining trunk was deposited with a licensed security firm under the classification “Precious Stones & Jewelry” to obscure its contents. With recent legal clarity, my two trusted colleagues and I now seek to transfer this asset abroad via diplomatic channels, a process requiring third-party collaboration.  \n\nDue to Nigerian Civil Service regulations prohibiting foreign account ownership, we require your assistance to receive and safeguard these funds internationally. The proposed process is as follows:  \n1. The security firm’s affiliate in London will dispatch the consignment as “personal valuables” under your name.  \n2. Upon arrival, you will retrieve the trunk and deposit the funds into a secure account.  \n3. Gradual remittances to Nigeria will be coordinated, with 20% of the total ($6,000,000.00 USD) allocated as your compensation.  \n\nThis transaction is legally protected under diplomatic immunity and poses no risk to you. Strict confidentiality is imperative.  \n\nContact Details for Further Discussion:  \n- Email: ben.suleman@fedcustoms.gov.ng  \n- Direct Line: +234 809 558 1234  \n- Office Address: Nigerian Customs Service, Cargo Wing, MMIA, Lagos.  \n\nKindly confirm your willingness to proceed via email at your earliest convenience.

Scam Indicators:\n • The offer of a huge sum of money with little or no explanation.\n • References to confidential or diplomatic channels meant to lure you into a sense of urgency and legitimacy.\n • Unsolicited contact from someone claiming to be a government official (or affiliated with one).\n • Requests for you to act as a facilitator or intermediary for transferring funds, with a promised commission.\n • A narrative that seems constructed to overcome your natural caution, citing legal immunity and unusual government procedures.\n\n2. What You Should Do:\n • Do not respond to this email or engage in any further communication.\n • Do not provide any personal details, financial information, or banking details.\n • Mark the email as spam or junk and delete it.\n • If you’re unsure or worried about security, consider reporting the email to your local law enforcement or a consumer fraud/warning agency in your jurisdiction.\n • Avoid clicking on any links or downloading any attachments in the message.\n\n3. General Caution:\n • Scammers often try to exploit people by promising big rewards for a small effort and may target innocent individuals globally.\n • Always verify any such proposal by contacting official channels directly—using contact information obtained independently from the internet—to check any claims if you suspect something might be amiss.\n • When in doubt, consult with a trusted professional or local authority.\n\nBottom line: You don’t need to pay attention to this email. Treat it as a scam attempt and take steps to protect yourself by not engaging."

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \nreceive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.\n\nYours faithfully,\nibrahim mussa,\nBill and exchange manager,\nAfrican Development bank ADB",

I am contacting you with a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your immediate attention and utmost discretion.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Henry Whitaker, tragically passed away in a plane crash alongside his immediate family. Following standard protocol, our institution has held his dormant account containing USD $10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) while awaiting claims from a verified next of kin. Regrettably, all documented relatives perished in the same incident, and no legitimate claimant has come forward in over two decades.  \n\nPer ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after a five-year period. However, due to Mr. Whitaker’s status as a foreign national, Burkina Faso law prohibits local citizens from acting as next of kin for international accounts. To resolve this matter, I propose a confidential partnership wherein you would be formally recognized as the beneficiary to facilitate the fund’s release.  \n\nTerms of Collaboration:  \n1. Your Role: Provide a non-Burkinabe bank account to receive the funds.  \n2. Distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (as the designated beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated for administrative and legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by my office for fiduciary management.  \n3. Process:  \n   - Submit a brief application to ADB, attesting to your relation to the deceased (template attached).  \n   - Provide your full banking details (account name, number, SWIFT/BIC) and contact information.  \n\nAll documentation will be processed under strict confidentiality. Upon approval, I will personally oversee the transfer and arrange to meet in your country for final disbursement.  \n\nRequired Details for Application:  \n- Full Name & Nationality  \n- Bank Name, Account Number, and SWIFT/BIC Code  \n- Contact Telephone/Fax Number  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: ibrahim.mussa@adb-bf.org  \n- Office Line: +226 25 44 58 90 (Mon–Fri, 8:00 AM–4:00 PM GMT)  \n\nThis proposal is time-bound, as the ADB treasury audit cycle concludes on [Date: 30 days from current date]. Immediate action is advised to secure the funds before reclassification.  \n\nI assure you this transaction adheres to all legal protocols and guarantees mutual benefit. Your prompt response is appreciated.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nIbrahim Mussa  \nBill and Exchange Manager  \nAfrican Development Bank (ADB), Ouagadougou  \n\n---  \nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

It displays multiple red flags common to fraudulent schemes, including:\n\n• Unsolicited notification of a large sum of money you supposedly have a right to claim.  \n• Requests for your personal and banking details (which scammers use for identity theft or financial fraud).  \n• A poorly verified sender address and unusual language for a reputed institution (like the African Development Bank).  \n• A time-sensitive urgency to pressure you into acting quickly without proper verification.  \n• The use of vague or generic explanations about the deceased and next-of-kin status.\n\nThe appropriate steps to handle this situation are:\n\n1. Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information (banking or otherwise).  \n2. Mark the email as spam/junk in your email client.  \n3. If you have concerns or doubts regarding any financial business opportunities, contact your bank or the official institution directly using contact details obtained from their verified website—not those provided in the suspicious email.  \n4. Maintain a healthy skepticism towards unsolicited proposals promising large returns with minimal effort.\n\nIn summary, disregard this email entirely and report it as spam."

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away in 1998. I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of handling sensitive international transactions.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s demise, the current administration has subjected me to relentless scrutiny and harassment, including freezing family assets and restricting my movements. While media reports claim the recovery of $700 million linked to my late husband’s accounts abroad, these allegations are exaggerated and politically motivated. To secure my future, I discreetly transferred $35 million USD to a private security firm in Europe (identity disclosed upon your agreement). Due to my house arrest, I cannot access these funds directly.  \n\nI seek your assistance to receive this amount into a secure bank account under your name. For your support, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million USD), with the remainder reserved for my relocation and legal fees. My family attorney, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu, will oversee all documentation and liaise with you confidentially. Rest assured, this transaction carries no legal risk, as I retain full authority over the funds.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $35,000,000.00 USD (held in escrow).  \n- Your Compensation: 20% ($7,000,000.00 USD).  \n- Confidentiality: Critical to avoid interception by Nigerian authorities.  \n- Next Steps: Reply to presidentwife@ngindiatimes.com and CC prof.adams@usa-mail.com to confirm your interest.  \n\nGiven surveillance measures, I cannot risk visiting embassies or using monitored communication channels.

Here’s what you need to know and how to handle it:\n\n• It’s fraudulent. The email uses a misleading narrative (a significant sum of money being transferred, a high commission for assistance, urgent and secretive instructions) that is typical of scams used to lure unsuspecting victims into providing personal or financial details, or even money.\n\n• Do not respond. Engaging with the sender could expose you to further scams or compromise your personal information.\n\n• Do not click any links or download any attachments. Scam emails may contain malware or phishing links designed to steal more personal data.\n\n• Mark the email as spam/junk. This helps filter out similar messages in your email client in the future.\n\n• Report to the appropriate authorities. If you feel concerned or if the scam is persistent, consider reporting it to your local consumer protection agency or your country’s cybercrime division. This can help raise awareness and potentially assist in tracking such fraudulent activities.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email beyond possibly reporting it as spam. It is best to delete it and not respond to preserve your online safety and security."

This letter must come to you\nas a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and\nbecome great friends and business partners.\nMy name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in\nGhana.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary.

My name is Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of a reputable financial institution in Kumasi, Ghana. I am reaching out to you in strict confidence to propose a legitimate collaboration that could yield significant mutual benefit.  \n\nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified an escrow account holding $12.5 million (USD). This account, opened in 1999, has remained inactive since 2000. Upon further investigation, I confirmed it belongs to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and Alaska resident who tragically perished with his family in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records corroborate this event (see [CNN Archives](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list) and [Thompson’s biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html)).  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account’s documentation, I confirmed no beneficiaries or next-of-kin claims exist. Per Ghanaian banking regulations, dormant accounts without claimants after 10 years may be transferred to the state. However, as Branch Manager, I retain discretionary authority to expedite the release of funds to a verified foreign next-of-kin.  \n\nProposed Collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Mr. Thompson’s designated foreign beneficiary.  \n2. I will furnish all necessary legal and financial documentation to validate your claim.  \n3. Funds will be securely transferred to your nominated account.  \n\nThis process is fully compliant with institutional protocols, ensuring zero legal exposure. Upon successful transfer, I propose a 60-40% split in your favor, though terms are negotiable.  \n\nContact Details:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Mobile)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n- Email: godwin.akwesi@kumasi-bank.com.gh  \n\nTime sensitivity is critical, as internal audits occur quarterly.

        "one-round response": "This email has several hallmark characteristics of a scam—often referred to as a \"419\" or \"Nigerian prince\" scam. Here are some points to consider and steps you should take:\n\n1. Suspicious Credentials and Story:  \n • The email claims to offer a large sum of money through an urgent and confidential opportunity.  \n • The narrative describing dormant accounts, deceased beneficiaries, and the offer to share a significant percentage of funds is designed to grab your attention quickly.  \n • Legitimate financial institutions typically do not reach out unexpectedly to offer you a large sum of money, nor would they propose that you act as a beneficiary for a deceased person’s account.\n\n2. Unverified Sender Information:  \n • The sender’s details (name, title, and institution) are not verifiable through standard means, and the provided links and references are often used in scams to appear legitimate.  \n • Reputable financial institutions have robust security measures and would not use email to solicit such private information or involvement in a money transfer.\n\n3. Red Flags in Communication:  \n • Urgency (“time sensitivity” and “respond urgently”), which is commonly used to prevent you from taking time to verify the legitimacy of the offer.  \n • Any request to share personal banking details or identity information, which can lead to identity theft or financial fraud.\n\nAppropriate Steps to Handle the Email:\n\n• Do Not Respond or Click Any Links:  \n – Engage minimally with the email. Do not reply, click on the provided links or download any attachments.\n\n• Mark as Spam or Phishing:  \n – Use your email provider’s built-in tools to report this email as spam or phishing. This helps improve email security and protect others.\n\n• Do Not Share Personal Information:  \n – Refrain from sharing any personal, financial, or identification details that could be misused.\n\n• Maintain Skepticism:  \n – If you’re ever unsure about an unexpected business proposal or email involving large sums of money, independently verify the information through trusted sources (e.g., contacting your bank directly using a phone number from their official website).\n\n• Consider Informing Your IT/ Security Department:  \n – If you received this email on a work account or are concerned that your device or network could be targeted, inform your IT department or follow your organization’s protocol for reporting phishing attempts.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email beyond being cautious, and you should delete it after marking it as spam. Treat unsolicited proposals promising large, risk-free financial gains as highly suspect."

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as an independent auditing consultant for a prominent financial institution in Nigeria. I am writing to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate requiring urgent intervention.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit in 2022, I discovered an inactive account held by a deceased client, Mr. Alain Mercier, a French industrialist and long-term customer of the bank. Mr. Mercier tragically perished in the Concorde Flight AF4590 crash on July 25, 2000, alongside all passengers. The account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains dormant as no legal will or designated beneficiary was identified.  \n\nExtensive efforts to locate Mr. Mercier’s next of kin—including coordination with French authorities and private investigators—have been unsuccessful. Per Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to federal reserves after 25 years. In this case, the bank’s board has expedited proceedings to reclassify the funds by Q1 2024, with intentions to allocate them to government-administered trust funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the forfeiture of these funds, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal beneficiary via probate documentation, prepared by my associate attorney, Mr. Kwame Asante (Esq.).  \n2. The bank will authorize an initial transfer of $10,000,000.00 (USD) to your nominated account.  \n3.

Red Flags in the Email:\n • The email promises a large sum of money tied to an “unclaimed estate” and requests personal information.\n • It involves urgent action and secretive procedures, which is a common tactic to pressure recipients.\n • The details (a deceased French industrialist, specific crash details, detailed fee breakdowns) are crafted to seem legitimate but are generally fabricated.\n • The requirement for confirming sensitive personal details (like government-issued ID, bank account details) is a major warning sign.\n\n2. Why It’s Likely a Scam:\n • Scammers use elaborate stories to lure unsuspecting individuals into providing personal information or even transferring money.\n • Authentic financial institutions and legal entities do not make unsolicited offers of large sums without thorough verification and proper legal procedures.\n • The email has several inconsistencies and elements that are not typical of genuine legal or financial communications.\n\n3. What You Should Do:\n • Do NOT respond to the email or provide any personal information (your ID, bank details, or contact numbers).\n • Mark the email as spam or junk, and delete it.\n • Do not click on any links or download any attachments that might be included in such messages.\n • If you’re ever unsure about a financial or legal proposal, consult with a trusted professional or contact your local law enforcement for advice. You can also research online by looking for similar scam reports.\n • Consider reporting the email to your email provider and any relevant anti-fraud or consumer protection authorities.\n\nIn summary, this email is not something that deserves your attention—it’s best handled by deleting it immediately and not engaging in any way."

My name is Victoria Karegaye, and I am writing to seek your assistance with a sensitive financial matter. I apologize for reaching out unexpectedly, but circumstances have left me with limited options.  \n\nI am a 22-year-old Rwandan national, and my late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the managing director of Royal Diamond Company in Kigali. Tragically, both my parents lost their lives during the civil unrest in Rwanda several years ago. Before his passing, my father secured a deposit certificate at a reputable international bank in my name, valued at $2.75 million USD.  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to these funds. However, due to my current refugee status and strict international banking regulations (specifically AML/KYC policies for displaced persons), I am prohibited from opening an account to access the deposit. The bank has advised me to appoint a trusted representative abroad to facilitate the transfer on my behalf.  \n\nThis is where I humbly ask for your help. If you are willing to act as my intermediary, I will provide all necessary legal documents, including the deposit certificate, death certificates, and court affidavits. In return, you would retain 20% of the total amount as compensation for your assistance.  \n\nPlease note:  \n- The bank has confirmed this transaction complies with anti-money laundering laws, provided proper documentation is submitted.  \n- All communication will remain confidential.  \n- I can be reached at victoria.karegaye@yahoo.com or +250 78 345 6721 (WhatsApp) to discuss next steps.  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is legitimate. Should you require verification, the bank’s compliance officer, Mr. Daniel Müller, can confirm the details at dmuller@globaltrustbank.co.rw (Tel: +250 78 512 3094).  \n\nI look forward to your response.  \n\nKind regards,  \nVictoria Karegaye  \nKigali, Rwanda",

The story of international banking hurdles, refugee status, and legal proceedings is designed to evoke sympathy and urgency.\n\n• Request to Act as an Intermediary: Legitimate financial institutions or legal processes would not require a random person to act as their intermediary for such large sums. Handling funds for someone you don’t know is both risky and likely illegal if it turns out to be a scam.\n\nWhat you should do:\n1. Do Not Respond – Do not reply to or engage with the sender.\n2. Do Not Share Personal Information – Avoid providing any personal, financial, or identification information.\n3. Mark as Spam/Report – If your email provider offers a “report spam” button, use it. You might also consider notifying your IT department if you received it at a work email.\n4. Delete the Email – Remove the email from your inbox to avoid any future contact. \n5. Consider Additional Precautions – If you're curious or feel uncertain, you can verify details independently, but proceed with extreme caution. Legitimate financial matters usually come with official documentation and are conducted through secure channels—not via unexpected emails.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email. It exhibits several classic scam indicators, and the safest course of action is to ignore and delete it."

Per our banking regulations, unclaimed funds revert to the national treasury after four years. Despite efforts to locate next of kin, no claimants have come forward, and the deadline for disbursement is imminent.  \n\nAs a foreign national, Mr. Thompson’s estate requires a non-Burkinabé beneficiary to process the transfer. Upon your agreement, I will furnish legal documentation designating you as the next of kin.

A reputable bank would not approach random individuals with such requests.\n\n• Offers to allocate a percentage of a large sum to you in exchange for your “assistance” are typical of advance-fee or fraudulent inheritance scams, which are designed to extract personal information or money from unwitting victims.\n\nWhat you should do:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information. Engaging with the sender could encourage further scam attempts.\n\n2. Do Not Click on Links or Open Attachments: These may contain malware or be part of phishing schemes intended to compromise your device or steal sensitive data.\n\n3. Mark It as Spam/Phishing: Use your email provider’s features to report the message as spam or phishing.\n\n4. Verify Information Independently: If you feel uncertain or curious, contact the official bank directly using contact information obtained from their verified website—do not use any contact details provided in the email.\n\n5. Remain Cautious: Be skeptical of any unsolicited offers or urgent financial proposals that seem too good to be true. Legitimate organizations rarely contact individuals out of the blue with such offers.\n\nIn summary, it’s best to ignore and delete the email. Stay cautious and protect your personal information."

My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (1960–2002), was involved in arms distribution in conflict zones during his lifetime.

Do not reply to the email or provide any personal, banking, or other sensitive information.  \n2. Do not click on any links or open any attachments that might accompany the email.  \n3. Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client, and consider blocking the sender.  \n4.

Protect your personal information and financial details, and always verify through independent and reliable channels before engaging."

I am the widow of Daniel Somba, who served as a diplomatic attaché at the Indian Embassy in Ivory Coast until his untimely passing in 2001 after a brief illness. We were married for eleven years but were not blessed with children.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my faith. Before his passing, Daniel entrusted $5.5 million USD to a private security depository here in Abidjan to secure our family’s future. Regrettably, my health has deteriorated in recent years. I have been diagnosed with terminal cancer and have also suffered multiple strokes, leaving me unable to manage this matter personally.  \n\nWith no immediate family to inherit these funds, I feel compelled by scripture (“Blessed is the hand that gives”) to direct this money toward charitable causes aligned with my faith. Specifically, I seek a trustworthy individual or organization to use the funds for orphanages, widows’ support, and the maintenance of places of worship.  \n\nI have already provided the depository, Abidjan Secure Holdings, with legal documentation authorizing the release of these funds to a designated beneficiary. To proceed, please contact their transfer officer, Mr. Amadou Kouyaté, at +225 07 49 32 18 55 or askouyate@abjsecure.ci, referencing Case ID SHV-5543-09B.

Recommended Action:​\n   • Do not reply to the email or provide any personal, financial, or sensitive information.  \n   • Do not call or email any provided contact details.  \n   • Mark the email as spam or junk and delete it.  \n   • If you’re ever unsure, you can forward such messages to your email provider’s abuse or phishing reports for further review.\n\n4. Protecting Yourself:​\n   • Remember that if an unsolicited email promises an unlikely financial windfall or asks you to use your bank account details for a transfer, it is most likely a scam.\n   • Be cautious with any emails that require fast action, as urgency is a common tactic employed by scammers.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email beyond being aware that it is a scam. The appropriate response is to delete the email and refrain from providing any of your personal or financial information.\n\nStay safe and vigilant!"

I am contacting you regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring immediate attention.  \n\nDuring a routine audit, my team discovered an unclaimed account holding $15,000,000 USD belonging to a foreign client who, along with his family, tragically perished in a plane crash in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, we have confirmed no surviving relatives exist to claim these funds. Per our banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the state treasury after five years (December 2024). To avoid this outcome, I propose a lawful collaboration to secure the funds.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Legal Requirement: As the deceased was a foreign national, a non-Burkinabé individual must act as the designated beneficiary.  \n- Distribution:  \n  - 30% to you (as beneficiary).  \n  - 10% to cover administrative and legal fees.  \n  - 60% retained by my team for charitable initiatives in Burkina Faso.  \n- Process: You will submit a notarized affidavit confirming your status as a distant relative. My team will handle all documentation and liaise with the Foreign Remittance Department.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and provide:  \n   - Full name, contact number, and a secure email.  \n   - Bank account details (IBAN/SWIFT) for the transfer.  \n2. I will forward the affidavit template and procedural guidelines via encrypted email.  \n\nConfidentiality is paramount, as disclosure would compromise both your eligibility and my position. This transaction adheres to all international banking protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy.  \n\nYou may reach me at +226 75 43 21 09 or jkabure.audit@bco-bfa.bf. A response within 72 hours is critical to meet regulatory deadlines.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Jean Kaburé  \nAudit Manager | Banque de Commerce Ouagadougou  \nAvenue de la Grande Chancellerie, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso  \nTel: +226 75 43 21 09 | Email: jkabure.audit@bco-bfa.bf  \n\n---  \nThis communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

        "one-round response": "This email strongly resembles a well-known scam (often referred to as an “advance-fee scam” or “419 scam”) that attempts to trick recipients into providing personal data and bank account details. Here’s what to know and how to handle it:\n\n1. Likelihood of Fraud:  \n   • The email uses urgent language, promises a large sum of money for minimal effort, and includes peculiar details (like acting as a “distant relative” or beneficiary).  \n   • The sender’s claims about unclaimed funds and procedures align with common scamming tactics and are not typical of legitimate banking communications.\n\n2. Red Flags:  \n   • Unsolicited emails promising substantial funds.  \n   • Requests for personal and bank details early in the conversation.  \n   • Unusual and inconsistent story elements (such as the details of the deceased client and the division of money).  \n   • Pressure to respond quickly (within 72 hours) to meet regulatory deadlines.\n\n3. Appropriate Actions:  \n   • Do not reply to the email.  \n   • Do not provide any personal, financial, or sensitive information.  \n   • Mark the email as spam or phishing in your email client.  \n   • Delete the email from your inbox.  \n   • If you’re concerned about your online security or if you inadvertently replied with any personal details, consider contacting your bank or IT support for additional guidance.\n\n4. Reporting (Optional):  \n   • You may report the scam to your country’s cybersecurity or fraud prevention agencies (for example, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center if you are in the U.S.) or your local law enforcement.\n\nIn summary, you do not need to pay attention to this email. The safest course of action is to ignore, mark as spam, and delete it without engaging further."

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits several red flags that strongly suggest it is a scam:\n\n• It involves an unsolicited notification of a very large sum of money (over US$15 million), which is a common tactic in fraud schemes.\n\n• The email prompts you to confirm or modify banking details, claiming to redirect funds based on an unverified representative. Scammers often use this method to trick recipients into providing personal and financial information.\n\n• The sender’s details, including phone numbers, addresses, and email contacts, may be fabricated or spoofed. It’s unusual for legitimate high-value transactions to be handled in this manner via unsecured email channels.\n\n• The urgency in the subject line and response deadline is a typical pressure tactic intended to prompt a quick, unreflective response without due diligence.\n\nAppropriate Steps to Take:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal, financial, or sensitive information. Any response might encourage further attempts by the scammer or lead to identity and bank account compromise.\n\n2. Do Not Click on Links or Download Attachments: These might be malicious and could compromise your computer or personal data.\n\n3. Verify Through Trusted Sources: If you’re ever in doubt about communications relating to financial matters, contact the relevant official institution directly using verified and reputable contact methods (for example, check official websites or previously established contacts) rather than those provided in the suspicious message.\n\n4. Report the Email: Consider reporting the email to your local cybercrime unit or to a consumer protection agency. You might also forward it to your email provider’s abuse or phishing report team.\n\n5. Mark as Spam: After reporting, mark the email as spam or junk to prevent potential future contact from the sender.\n\nIn summary, the email in question looks like a fraud attempt, and you should ignore and delete it rather than take any actions that might expose your personal or financial information."

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch.  \n\nAccount Details:  \n- Account Holder: Engr. Lee Seunghyo (Deceased)  \n- Deposit Amount: USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars)  \n- Deposit Tenure: 12-month fixed term (matured August 1998)  \n\nBackground:  \nEngr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), opened this account in 1997. Regrettably, he perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam on August 6, 1997. Following standard protocols, our bank issued notifications to his registered address upon the deposit’s maturity. After receiving no response, we liaised with the NNPC, confirming his demise and the absence of a legally declared next of kin or will.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 10-year dormancy period are subject to escheatment to the Federal Government. This account is now at risk of forfeiture, as no beneficiaries have come forward in 26 years.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the funds from being absorbed into government holdings, I propose a lawful collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Engr. Lee’s designated beneficiary via probate documents.  \n2. Two licensed attorneys will draft and notarize the requisite affidavits and a retroactive will.  \n3. Funds will be transferred to a non-Nigerian account (mandated for USD repatriation).  \n\nRequired Information:  \nTo initiate documentation, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Legal Name & Residential Address  \n2. Date of Birth  \n3. Direct Contact Number  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (USD 13,750,000.00)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (USD 1,250,000.00)  \n\nThis transaction is time-sensitive. A provisional Order of Mandamus has been secured to fast-track beneficiary claims, but we must act before the Q3 2024 regulatory audit.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nReply to this email to confirm your interest. I will then forward attorney contact details and a secure portal link to submit your information. All communications remain confidential under Section 12(d) of the Nigerian Banking Secrecy Act.  \n\nShould you decline, kindly notify me promptly so I may pursue alternate candidates.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDonald Ofu Obidima  \nSenior Credit Control Manager  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria  \nPhone: +234 809 755 4301  \nEmail: donald.obidima@uniontrustbank-ng.com  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) | RC 41981  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

Warning signs in the email:\n • The email involves a large sum of money from an unclaimed account with unusually high returns and a too-good-to-be-true compensation split.\n • It uses an unsolicited proposal involving sensitive personal information and legal documents.\n • The sender's email address and details may not match the official contact information of a reputable financial institution.\n • Requests for personal information (such as your full legal name, address, date of birth, and phone number) are classic phishing tactics.\n • The narrative and urgency (mentioning regulatory deadlines and legal orders) are common techniques to pressure you into acting quickly without proper verification.\n\n2. How to handle it:\n • Do not reply to the email or provide any personal or financial details.\n • Do not click on any links or download any attachments that might be included.\n • Mark the message as spam or junk in your email client.\n • If you’re concerned about potential security risks, consider running an updated antivirus/malware scan on your device.\n • You might also consider notifying your email provider about the suspicious message.\n\n3. Verify independently:\n • If you ever receive similar emails regarding financial matters, independently verify the legitimacy by contacting the bank or institution using verified contact details available on their official website.\n • Consult with a trusted legal or financial advisor if ever in doubt about unsolicited offers or claims of large sums of money.\n\nOverall, do not engage with the email. It is best to ignore, block the sender, and report it as a possible scam."

        "generated text": "\n\nSubject: Urgent Request for Trusted Assistance in Securing Legacy Funds  \n\nDear Sir/Madam,  \n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Mrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye, widow of the late Mr. Issac Nuhan Vaye, who served as Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia until his untimely death in 2003. I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances, seeking your discretion and assistance.  \n\nAs you may be aware from international media coverage (e.g., BBC, CNN), Liberia endured significant political instability during the presidency of Charles Taylor. My husband was wrongfully accused of conspiring against Taylor’s regime and executed without trial. Before his death, he discreetly secured $21.5 million USD through diplomatic channels, originally intended for agricultural infrastructure projects. These funds remain held by a private security logistics firm in Europe, awaiting legitimate transfer to a trustworthy partner.  \n\nDue to my restricted mobility (I am confined to our family estate under government surveillance) and monitored communications, I cannot act directly. My legal representative, Barrister James Broderick (based in London, UK), will facilitate the process. He will furnish you with documentation to verify this matter, including proof of deposit and my husband’s political records.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. Barrister Broderick will coordinate with the security firm to transfer the funds to a designated account under your name.  \n2. For your assistance, 20% ($4.3 million USD) will be allocated to you, with the remainder reserved for relocating my family and reinvesting in Liberia’s agricultural sector.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nPlease contact Barrister Broderick directly via the details below to initiate proceedings. He will require your:  \n- Full name  \n- Residential/company address  \n- Private telephone and fax numbers (for secure communication)  \n\nContact Information:  \nName: Barrister James Broderick, Esq.  \nTel: +44 7040 120730  \nFax: +44 870 1348903  \nEmail: brr.jmsbroderick@kaixo.com | james.broderick@yahoo.com.hk  \n\nThis transaction is legally structured to comply with international financial regulations. However, confidentiality is critical given Liberia’s fragile political climate. I implore you to treat this matter with urgency and discretion.  \n\nShould you require independent verification, I encourage you to reference historical reports on my husband’s case via reputable outlets such as The Guardian or Reuters (search terms: “Isaac Nuhan Vaye,” “Liberia 2003 coup allegations”).  \n\nI respectfully request your prompt response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nMrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye  \nMonrovia, Liberia",

        "one-round response": "This email has all the hallmarks of a scam and should be treated with extreme caution. Here’s what to consider and how to handle it:\n\n1. Likelihood of Fraud:  \n • The email asks for personal details (full name, address, telephone/fax numbers) through an unsolicited message.  \n • It involves a large sum of money and promises an unusually high commission (20% of $21.5 million), which is a common tactic in advance-fee or lottery scams.  \n • The narrative seems designed to evoke sympathy and urgency by mentioning political instability, wrongful execution, and government surveillance, which are typical features of scam stories.\n\n2. Verification Issues:  \n • There is no reliable way for you to independently verify the claims made in the email without providing sensitive details.  \n • The names, contact details, and locations mentioned are generic or unverifiable. Even if you search for reputable news outlets, these details could be fabricated or misrepresented.\n\n3. Appropriate Steps to Take:  \n • Do NOT respond to the email or provide any personal or financial information.  \n • Do not click on any links or open attachments that might be included in such emails.  \n • Mark the email as spam or phishing in your email client.  \n • If you’re curious or concerned, report the email to your email provider’s abuse or fraud team. You could also notify local law enforcement or consumer protection agencies about the suspicious message.\n\n4. General Best Practice:  \n • Unsolicited \"help me\" or \"urgent\" emails involving large sums of money are common scams designed to extract your personal details or money.  \n • Always be skeptical of any email that asks for confidential information or that requires you to act quickly without verifying the sender’s identity and the legitimacy of the request.\n\nIn summary, the safest and most appropriate action with this email is to disregard it and ensure that it’s filtered out of your inbox. Do not engage further, and report it as necessary."

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \nreceive this letter.

This communication pertains to an urgent financial matter requiring your immediate attention.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Gerald H. Bracken (deceased), held an account with a balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Tragically, Mr. Bracken and his immediate family perished in a plane crash in November of that year. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, no legal claimants have come forward. Per ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are designated for transfer to the national treasury after a 5-year dormancy period. However, due to Mr. Bracken’s foreign nationality, Burkinabé law prohibits local citizens from acting as claimants, necessitating international collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next of kin to facilitate the transfer of funds into a secure offshore account under your name.  \n2. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% to you (as the foreign partner).  \n   - 60% retained by myself (for administrative oversight).  \n   - 10% allocated for transaction-related expenses (legal fees, banking charges).  \n\nRequired Action:  \n- Provide your full banking details (bank name, account number, SWIFT/BIC code).  \n- Confirm a direct contact number and email for documentation.  \n\nUpon receipt of your details, I will forward a notarized affidavit of kinship and transfer authorization forms via encrypted email. Rest assured, this process adheres strictly to ADB protocols, and all documentation will be validated by our legal team to ensure compliance.  \n\nGiven the sensitive nature of this transaction, I urge discretion and prompt action to prevent forfeiture of these funds.

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits many classic signs of a scam and should be treated with extreme caution. Here are several points to consider:\n\n1. Suspicious Proposition: The email proposes a lucrative financial opportunity involving an enormous sum of money with minimal justification—this is a common tactic used to lure potential victims.\n\n2. Unsolicited Contact: If you did not initiate any business with the African Development Bank or have any prior connection with the purported sender, it’s highly unlikely that a legitimate bank would contact you out of the blue with such sensitive matters.\n\n3. Request for Personal Information: The email asks for your private banking details and personal contact information. Legitimate financial institutions and professionals will not request sensitive data via unverified or unsecured email communication.\n\n4. Unusual Distribution of Funds: The proposed process, including the division of funds (with a large portion supposedly allocated to the sender), is typical of scams, where the scammer ends up receiving a disproportionate “share.”\n\n5. Other Red Flags: Mismatches or anomalies in email domains, contact details, or the physical address provided can also be indicators of a fraudulent attempt.\n\nAppropriate Action Steps:\n\n• Do Not Respond: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information. Engaging with such messages could expose you to further scams or identity theft.\n\n• Mark as Spam/Report: Flag the email as spam/junk in your email account. You can also report it to your email provider to help block similar messages in the future.\n\n• Do Not Click Links or Download Attachments: If there are any links or attachments in the email, do not click or download them as they may contain malware or viruses.\n\n• Stay Informed: Familiarize yourself with common scam tactics. Legitimate organizations, especially financial institutions, have robust methods for contacting clients securely and would rarely (if ever) resort to these methods.\n\n• Report if Necessary: If you believe you have been targeted by a scam, consider reporting it to local law enforcement or a cybercrime agency in your country.\n\nIn summary, treat this email as a scam attempt. There is no need to pay attention or engage with it in any way. Always prioritize your digital security by verifying unexpected communications with trusted sources before sharing any sensitive information."

My name is Mrs. Comfort Somba, a widow residing in Chennai, India. My late husband, Mr. Daniel Somba, served as a senior diplomat at the Indian Embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for nine years until his untimely passing in 2001 due to complications from pneumonia. We were married for 11 years but had no children.  \n\nFollowing Daniel’s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my Christian faith. During his tenure abroad, my husband prudently secured a savings deposit of $5.5 million USD (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with Abidjan Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed private security vaulting firm in Ivory Coast.  \n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer and have suffered recurring complications from a stroke, leaving me physically weakened. Given my prognosis, I seek a compassionate, God-fearing individual or organization to steward these funds in alignment with biblical principles. Per my late husband’s wishes, the funds must be used to:  \n1. Support orphanages and widows in underserved communities.  \n2. Maintain places of worship and fund evangelistic missions.  \n3. Distribute Bibles and educational resources to impoverished regions.  \n\nAll legal documentation, including a notarized Letter of Authority and my husband’s deposit certificates, has been prearranged with Abidjan Secure Holdings. Upon your confirmation, their transfer department will validate your identity and initiate the release process. I have attached a reference case number (ASHL-1149/CS) for expedited handling.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact Mr. Amara Diallo, Senior Client Relations Officer, directly via:  \n- Email: client.services@abidjansecureholdings.ci  \n- Telephone: +225 07 85 23 41 09 (WhatsApp available)  \n\nPlease provide your full name, contact details, and a brief explanation of how you intend to fulfill this mission.

Unsolicited Request: Genuine business or charitable opportunities usually do not reach out in such a manner, particularly from unknown individuals using free or generic email addresses.\n\n2. Emotional Manipulation: Scammers often use emotional stories (illness, loss, philanthropy) to create urgency and prompt quick action without a thorough review of the details.\n\n3. Red Flags in Details: The email includes multiple red flags such as:\n   - Unusual request to act as a steward for a large sum of money.\n   - Inconsistencies or overly detailed personal information aimed at making the story more believable.\n   - Requesting personal contact details and information upfront.\n\n4. Lack of Verifiable Credentials: You cannot easily verify the identity of Mrs. Comfort Somba or the legitimacy of Abidjan Secure Holdings Ltd., and the contact details provided do not inspire confidence.\n\n5. Risks Involved: Engaging with such emails could result in identity theft, financial scams, or other harmful consequences.\n\nAppropriate Steps to Take:\n\n• Do NOT respond to or engage with the email.\n• Avoid providing any personal, financial, or contact information.\n• Mark the email as spam and delete it from your inbox.\n• If you believe the email might be of interest to local authorities or if you receive similar messages repeatedly, consider reporting it to your country's cybercrime or fraud prevention unit.\n\nIn summary, it is best not to pay attention to or interact with this email. Instead, exercise caution, protect your personal information, and report or delete the message."

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary.

My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of Kumasi Commercial Bank in Ghana. I am writing to you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive financial matter that requires your cooperation.  \n\n### Background of the Proposal  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts at our branch, I discovered an escrow account holding USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This account has remained inactive for nearly five years and is registered under the name of Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska.  \n\nRegrettably, Mr. Thompson and his family perished in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records confirm this tragedy, which you may verify through reputable sources such as:  \n- [CNN Archives: Alaska Airlines Crash Report](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska-airlines-list)  \n- [Morris Thompson’s Biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mthompson)  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account, I confirmed that no beneficiaries or next-of-kin were ever designated. Under Ghanaian banking regulations, unclaimed assets of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the state.  \n\n### Request for Collaboration  \nTo lawfully transfer these funds, I require a foreign partner to act as the legal next-of-kin to Mr. Thompson. As Branch Manager, I am positioned to authorize the release of the funds once credible documentation is submitted. Your role would involve:  \n1. Providing a valid international passport for identity verification.  \n2. Signing affidavits (prepared by my legal team) to establish your claim.  \n3. Receiving the funds into your designated account, after which we would share the proceeds.  \n\n### Proposed Terms  \n- 60% of the total amount to you (USD 7,500,000.00).  \n- 40% retained by me to cover administrative and legal expenses.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with my bank’s internal protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid external interference.  \n\n### Next Steps  \nIf agreeable, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Office Hours: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM GMT)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n\nI urge discretion and prompt action to secure this opportunity.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMr. Godwin Akwesi  \nBranch Manager  \nKumasi Commercial Bank  \nAddress: PMB 245, Adum, Kumasi, Ghana  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money. In view of this, The monetary policylaw does not allow such \ninvestment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can \nassist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.\n\n\nAs I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this\ninformation as top secret.

My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent farmer and opposition leader within Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, seeking your partnership to secure a family legacy.  \n\nPrior to his assassination by agents of the current regime, my father discreetly safeguarded USD $10,000,000 in the form of gemstones within a sealed metal trunk. This asset was intended to fund agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini but could not be utilized due to the government’s unlawful seizure of our estates and bank accounts. As the sole surviving heir, I am now tasked with relocating these funds abroad to reinvest them safely.  \n\nDue to my status as a political refugee in South Africa, local financial regulations restrict my ability to claim or manage such assets directly. I require a trusted partner in your country to act as the legal custodian of the trunk until I can establish residency. In return for your assistance, I am prepared to offer 15% of the total value ($1,500,000) as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will follow international legal protocols through a licensed security firm in Johannesburg. Strict confidentiality is imperative, as exposure could jeopardize both our safety and the success of this endeavor.  \n\nIf you are willing to assist, kindly confirm at your earliest convenience.

        "one-round response": "This email contains many red flags that are common in fraud or scam messages. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n• Unsolicited Financial Opportunity: It’s unusual to receive an unexpected email offering a lucrative business proposal from someone “unknown” who claims to have access to large sums of money.\n\n• Emotional Urgency and Confidentiality: The email emphasizes urgency and strict confidentiality. Scammers often try to pressure you by invoking secrecy and the need for rapid action.\n\n• Overly Elaborate Narrative: The backstory—political refugees, assassination, hidden assets—seems designed to evoke an emotional response and overcome skepticism by building a dramatic tale.\n\n• Request to Act as a Custodian: The proposed role of “legal custodian” for a large amount of money (or assets) without any secure or verifiable process is a hallmark of scams (similar to the “advance-fee scam” or “419 scam” schemes).\n\n• Non-Corporate Contact Details: The message comes from an individual account (rather than an official institutional email), and the details provided (phone numbers, email address) are typical of scams rather than verified professional contacts.\n\nGiven these factors, here’s the appropriate way to handle the situation:\n\n1. Do Not Respond: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal or financial information. Scammers often use your reply as a means to further engage you and gain more information.\n\n2. Do Not Click Any Links or Download Attachments: If there are any links or attachments (even if they aren’t explicitly mentioned in the text you shared), avoid clicking or downloading them as they could contain malware.\n\n3. Mark as Spam/Report: Mark the email as spam in your email client. You may also consider reporting it to your email provider or local cybercrime authorities if you feel it’s necessary.\n\n4. Verify Independently: If you are ever in doubt about any financial proposal or contact, verify the information independently through trusted sources or official channels. Don’t rely on contact details provided in the suspicious email.\n\n5. Consult Trusted Professionals: If you have any lingering doubts, you might consider consulting with a trusted professional (for example, your bank’s fraud department or a legal advisor) for further guidance.\n\nIn summary, this email strongly resembles a common scam tactic. It would be best to ignore and delete it without engaging further. Stay cautious with unsolicited communications that appear too good to be true—they usually are."

My name is Christina Holden, widow of Dr. Donald Holden, a Canadian geologist who worked with Shell Oil in Calgary until his passing in 2019 after a sudden cardiac event. During our 11-year marriage, we remained childless but committed to our faith as active members of Trinity Baptist Church in Vancouver.  \n\nFollowing Donald’s death, I relocated to Ottawa to manage his estate, which includes a $10.5 million trust fund held with Reserve Finance & Trust (Toronto branch), established through his lifetime savings. Recently, I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic cancer at St. Michael’s Hospital. My prognosis is limited, compounded by a mild stroke last month that has left me with limited mobility.  \n\nGiven my circumstances, I seek to transfer this fund to a reputable religious organization to fulfill our shared commitment to supporting orphanages, medical care for the disabled, and widows in underserved communities. My husband’s family, while kind, does not share our faith, and I cannot risk the funds being diverted from their intended purpose.  \n\nTo proceed, I require your official church documentation (registration details, mission statement, and recent charitable project summaries) to forward to my estate lawyer, Mr. James Miller (james.miller@holdenlegal.ca | +1-613-555-0198), who will draft the transfer paperwork. Strict confidentiality is essential to avoid external interference.  \n\nUpon verification, the funds will be released to your church’s designated account within 7–10 business days. I humbly ask for your prayers during this time and assurance that the funds will be managed per 1 Timothy 6:18–19. Kindly respond by August 25th to ensure timely processing.  \n\nMay God bless your ministry.  \n\nSincerely in Christ,  \nChristina Holden  \n34 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa, ON K1P 1C7  \nchristina.holden1948@outlook.com | +1-613-555-0126  \n\nNote: All correspondence must be copied to Mr. Miller for legal oversight.",

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits several hallmarks of a scam and should be treated with extreme caution. Here are some points to consider and steps to handle it appropriately:\n\n1. Suspicious elements in the email:\n  • The email uses an urgent tone and emotional appeal (mentioning terminal illness and a large sum of money), which is a common tactic in scams.\n  • The sender is asking for your church’s official documentation upfront before any formal processes are verified.\n  • The involvement of a large sum of money and an \"urgent\" deadline are classic red flags.\n  • The sender’s and lawyer’s contact details, as well as the narrative, seem engineered to gain trust and prompt a rapid response without proper due diligence.\n\n2. What you should not do:\n  • Do not reply with any personal or organizational details.\n  • Do not send any documentation or sensitive information without third-party verification from trusted sources.\n  • Do not click on any links or open attachments (if there are any) without confirming its legitimacy.\n\n3. Steps to take:\n  • Report the email: Consider reporting it to your organization’s IT or security team, or to local authorities if you suspect fraudulent activity.\n  • Verify internally: Consult with trusted colleagues within your organization (or with your church’s leadership) to see if anyone else has received a similar message.\n  • Do not engage: Avoid responding to the email until you have independently verified its authenticity through official channels (for example, by contacting the purported lawyer’s office using contact details found independently of the email).\n\n4. General advice for handling similar emails:\n  • Maintain a healthy level of skepticism, especially when large sums or urgent requests are involved.\n  • Always double-check credentials and legitimacy through independent research or direct contact with organizations mentioned.\n  • Use established, trusted channels for any financial or sensitive exchanges rather than email communications.\n\nIn summary, you should not pay attention to this email in its current form. Instead, treat it as a potential scam and take the necessary steps to verify its authenticity before taking any action."

But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you with a heartfelt appeal for assistance in fulfilling a final humanitarian endeavor.  \n\nI am a Dubai-based oil merchant currently undergoing treatment for late-stage cancer. My prognosis, as confirmed by my medical team at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, leaves me with limited time. While I have allocated most of my assets to family, recent events have compelled me to seek an external partner to ensure a portion of my wealth reaches those truly in need.  \n\nSpecifically, I seek your help in disbursing $35 million USD held in a secured vault at Al-Madina Trust Vault Services (Dubai) since 2003. These funds were earmarked for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. Regrettably, my deteriorating health prevents me from overseeing this personally, and past reliance on family for similar tasks proved disappointing.  \n\nHow You Can Assist:  \n1. Authorization: I will formally designate you as my representative to retrieve the funds.  \n2. Disbursement: 90% ($31.5M) will be distributed to vetted NGOs, including CARE International and the Red Crescent Society.  \n3. Compensation: 10% ($3.5M) will be transferred to you for your time and administrative efforts.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- Full legal name and current residential address  \n- Mobile/office contact number (e.g., +971-12-523-5672)  \n- Occupation and professional background (for due diligence)  \n\nUpon confirmation, my legal advisor, Mr. Karim Al-Farsi (+971-55-632-1890 / k.al-farsi@almadinatrust.ae), will coordinate with you to initiate the process.  \n\nI understand this request may seem unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith.

Here’s how you can handle it safely:\n\n1. Check the sender’s information: Look at the email address and domain. Does it match what you’ve seen before from GTE Federal Credit Union? If it’s slightly different or appears odd, that might be a red flag.\n\n2. Verify through official channels: Instead of using the links or contact information in the email, visit the official website (by typing the URL into your browser directly) or give the credit union a call using a number you already have on file (or that you find on their official website). Ask if they’re sending out such surveys.\n\n3. Hover over links: Without clicking, hover your mouse over any links to see if the URL matches the credit union’s official domain. Mismatched or unfamiliar URLs can be a sign of phishing.\n\n4. Never provide sensitive data: As noted in the email’s disclaimer, legitimate communications from GTE Federal Credit Union would not ask for sensitive information like passwords or Social Security numbers. Be cautious if the survey starts asking for more personal details than expected.\n\n5. Keep your security software updated: Ensure that your antivirus and other security measures are up to date, so that if you accidentally click on something malicious, you’re better protected.\n\nIn summary, while the email appears to be a member survey from GTE Federal Credit Union, it’s wise to be cautious. Verify its legitimacy independently before taking any action. Doing so will help ensure that you don’t fall victim to a phishing scam."

        "one-round response": "The email looks like it’s meant to confirm the details of a subscription you (or someone using your email address) initiated for a product update. That said, you should always take a moment to verify such emails before acting. Here’s a step‐by‐step approach to handle it:\n\n1. Verify the Source:\n • Check the sender’s email address. Does it come from an address that matches the company’s official domain (lashcareinnovations.com)?\n • Look for any signs of odd formatting, spelling errors, or unusual links. In this case, the sender appears professional, but it’s always good to inspect carefully.\n\n2. Reflect on Your Subscription History:\n • Do you recall signing up for information or a subscription related to LashCare Innovations or their Root Rejuvenation Serum campaign? If you don’t remember doing so, it could be an error or, in rare cases, an attempt at phishing.\n • If you did sign up, then the email is likely a legitimate reminder regarding your subscription details.\n\n3. Interact Safely with Provided Links:\n • Hover over the link (without clicking) to confirm it leads to a lashcareinnovations.com subdomain. If it does, you’re likely safe.\n • If you’re ever in doubt, you might consider manually typing the company’s known URL into your browser instead of clicking a link in the email, then logging into your account to review your subscription settings.\n\n4. Decide on Your Next Steps:\n • If you actually want to continue receiving updates and products, there may be no action needed.\n • If you no longer want the emails or subscription, you can follow the instructions provided (click the “unsubscribe” link, reply with “UNSUBSCRIBE,” or contact their support). Make sure you’re comfortable with the security of these options.\n • In case you’re uncertain whether you authorized this subscription, it might be a good idea to contact their support team (using the phone number or email listed on their official website) to confirm your subscription details.\n\nIn summary, while nothing in the email immediately screams “phishing” or “spam,” it’s always best to be cautious. Verify that the email is genuinely from LashCare Innovations and that you recognize the subscription before clicking any links or making changes. This due diligence protects you from potential scams while ensuring your subscription preferences are correctly managed."

Verify the sender and source independently.  \n • Check if you have an established relationship with ConnectHarmony and if you usually receive emails from them.  \n • Look up their official website (by typing the URL manually in your browser) and contact them using the contact details provided on their verified site—not those in the email—to confirm whether the message is genuine.\n\n2. Inspect the email for red flags common in phishing attempts.  \n • Are the sender’s email address and domain consistent with the official communications from ConnectHarmony?  \n • Does the email ask you to click on links or provide personal details unexpectedly?  \n • Does the tone or urgency seem a bit off compared to previous communications you’ve received (if any)?\n\n3. Avoid clicking on any embedded links until you can confirm its legitimacy.  \n • Instead of clicking the links provided in the email, go directly to ConnectHarmony’s website (by entering the URL manually) and log in to check your account and communication preferences.  \n • If you suspect any unusual activity regarding your account, update your security settings via the official site.\n\n4. Contact the company directly using official contact information from their verified website or previous trusted communications.  \n • Explain the email you received and ask if it was sent by them.  \n • Use a phone number or email address you trust, not the ones provided in the suspicious email.\n\n5. If you determine that the email is suspicious or if you’re unsure, mark it as spam or report it as phishing to your email provider.  \n • You can also forward the email to the legitimate support or security contact (found on their verified website) so they can confirm or take appropriate action.\n\nTaking these precautions will help you avoid any potential phishing scams or fraudulent activities. In summary, it’s best to be cautious, verify the email’s legitimacy outside of the message itself, and avoid clicking any links until you’re completely sure the communication is genuine."

        "one-round response": "This email exhibits several red flags that suggest it may be a scam or phishing attempt. Here are some considerations and recommended steps:\n\n1. Conflicting Details:  \n • The email refers to Gulfport, MS (a U.S. location with zip code 39501) while at the same time mentioning the \"Netherlands Prize Administration\" and providing a Netherlands-based phone number. This mix of geographical references is unusual and inconsistent.  \n • The sender’s office address combines U.S. and Netherlands elements, which is not typical for an official government communication.\n\n2. Urgency and Pressure Tactics:  \n • The email sets a strict deadline (14 calendar days) to confirm eligibility, a common tactic designed to force quick decisions.  \n • It emphasizes that unclaimed benefits will be reallocated if you delay, pushing you to act without due diligence.\n\n3. Unfamiliar Request:  \n • If you weren’t expecting proactive outreach regarding a prize or benefit, receiving such an email should cause you to be extra cautious.  \n • The requirement to visit a portal and enter your Reference ID, postcode, and payment details is a common strategy in phishing scams designed to capture personal information.\n\n4. Steps to Safeguard Yourself:  \n • Do not click on any links or provide personal or financial information.  \n • Do not call the provided phone number until you’re certain of the email’s authenticity. Scammers often include realistic-looking contact details.  \n • If you think the email might be legitimate (for example, if you are part of a program you signed up for), independently verify by contacting the relevant official agency using contact information retrieved from their verified official website or trusted sources—not the details provided in the email.\n • Report the suspicious email to your local consumer protection office or the corresponding fraud reporting agency in your area.\n\n5. Conclusion:  \nIt is best to exercise caution and not engage with this email. Based on its conflicting information and the typical characteristics of phishing scams, it is prudent to disregard, delete, and report it if necessary. Verifying directly with known, trusted official entities is always the safest approach if you have any doubt.\n\nTaking these precautions will help protect you from potential scams and phishing attacks."

Many phishing emails try to create a sense of urgency and use official-looking logos or content to trick you into clicking on links or providing personal information. Here’s how you should approach it:\n\n1. Verify the sender: Check the email header and address carefully. Phishing emails often come from addresses that aren’t genuinely from your bank. Even if the logo or formatting appears authentic, the sender’s email or the domain used in the link may be off.\n\n2. Don't click on any links: Even though the email contains a link that appears to be secure, it’s best not to click on it if you weren’t expecting an account update. Phishers often use look-alike domain names (in this case, secure.barclays-update.com doesn’t look like Barclays’ usual domain) to harvest credentials or deliver malware.\n\n3. Contact your bank directly: Use a trusted method to get in touch with Barclays. Find their official customer support number from the back of your bank card or by visiting the official Barclays website. Ask if they have recently sent any such communications and whether any action is required from your side.\n\n4. Keep an eye on your account: Log in to your account by typing the known URL directly into your browser (don’t use links from emails) to check for any notifications or alerts regarding security updates.\n\nIn summary, do not act on the instructions in the email until you have independently verified its authenticity through official Barclays channels. If the email turns out to be fake, report it to your bank so they can take further action."

        "one-round response": "This email might be tempting, but it’s important to proceed with caution. Here are some steps and tips on how to handle it:\n\n1. Verify the source independently. Do not click on links or call any numbers provided directly from the email. Instead, go to Costco’s official website by typing the URL (www.costco.com) into your browser or using a trusted bookmark. Once there, log into your account to see if a reward or similar message appears in your account dashboard or “Member Benefits” section.\n\n2. Check the email details. While the email appears to reference a $100 reward, take note of small details such as the sender’s email domain. Although some companies use third-party email addresses for marketing, it’s always good to verify whether “rewards@costco-communications.com” is an address that Costco has officially endorsed. You might also compare it with previous emails you’ve received from Costco or contact Costco customer service using a number or email address you know is legitimate (do not use the ones given in this email).\n\n3. Be cautious with links and attachments. Even if the email looks genuine, phishing attempts can mimic legitimate emails to steal your login credentials or personal information. Always hover over any links (without clicking) to check whether the URL seems to be associated with the official Costco website.\n\n4. Contact Costco directly. If you’re unsure about the email’s legitimacy, call Costco’s official customer service number (found on their verified website) or visit a local warehouse. Explain the situation and ask if this reward email is legitimate. This additional verification step can help prevent falling for a scam.\n\n5. Do not share sensitive information. Legitimate emails from reputable companies like Costco will never ask you to provide sensitive personal information (passwords, credit card details, Social Security numbers, etc.) in response to an email.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can verify the legitimacy of the reward offer without exposing yourself to potential scams or phishing attempts. In summary, pay attention and verify the details using trusted, official sources rather than relying solely on the email."

        "one-round response": "This email might be legitimate, but it’s always wise to verify unsolicited emails—especially ones involving surveys and rewards—even when they appear to come from a familiar institution. Here’s a good approach to handling it:\n\n1. Check the sender’s details. Look at the “from” email address and any contact information. Does it match what you normally see from GTE Federal Credit Union in past communications? If something seems off, it may be cause for extra caution.\n\n2. Be cautious with links. Rather than clicking the link in the email, type the credit union’s official website address directly into your browser or use your official banking app. That way, you can navigate to any survey or promotion that might be running without relying solely on what the email provided.\n\n3. Contact the bank directly. If you’re unsure about the email’s authenticity, call GTE Federal Credit Union using the number you already trust (for example, one found on your credit union’s official site or on your account statements). Ask whether they sent the survey invitation and verify any details about rewards or promotions.\n\n4. Avoid providing sensitive information. The email states they won’t ask for sensitive data, which is a good sign. Still, never enter login credentials or personal data unless you’re confident you’re on an official and secure site.\n\n5. Look for subtle red flags. While the email appears professional, check details such as website addresses (for instance, an “https://” is generally expected for secure transactions, so the absence of it warrants a double-check) and any language that seems inconsistent with previous communications from your credit union.\n\nIn summary, while you don’t necessarily need to ignore the email outright, treat it with a healthy dose of caution by verifying its authenticity through independent means rather than clicking on links directly. This way, you ensure your personal and financial information stays safe."

        "one-round response": "This email definitely warrants attention, but you should proceed cautiously. Here are some steps and considerations to help guide your response:\n\n1. Verify the source and legitimacy:\n • Check the sender’s email address and domain. Although the address (legal@shafaqchyanne.media) might seem professional, it’s important to verify if it corresponds with any known or reputable copyright firm or individual.\n • Examine the email headers carefully to see if it actually originated from the claimed sender.\n • Look up the sender’s name and contact information independently (using trusted sources) to see if there’s any history or reputation attached.\n\n2. Don’t click on links or download files immediately:\n • The email contains a link to external evidence. Do not click on this link until you are certain of the email’s legitimacy. Suspicious links can be a vector for malware or phishing.\n • Instead, consider asking for additional details or requesting that the evidence be sent via a secure, well-known platform or redacted email attachment.\n\n3. Consult your organization’s procedures:\n • As a University Web Administrator, you likely have a designated process for handling DMCA takedown notices. Forward the email (along with any attachments or links) to your institution’s legal department or designated DMCA agent for verification and appropriate action.\n • Follow any internal guidelines regarding DMCA claims while ensuring that you do not act unilaterally without verifying the claim’s validity.\n\n4. Do not make any payments or take drastic actions immediately:\n • DMCA takedown notices by themselves do not require any payment. Legitimate notices demand removal of content, not a fee. Be wary if any additional communications begin asking you for money.\n • Ensure that any content removal decisions are reviewed by your legal team; if the claimed infringement is valid, they may advise if a takedown is necessary.\n\n5. Document everything:\n • Keep a detailed record of the email, its headers, and any subsequent communications. This documentation can be crucial if the situation escalates or if you need to demonstrate that you followed proper procedures.\n\n6. Engage legal counsel:\n • Because the email cites specific sections of the DMCA and threatens statutory damages if you don’t comply within 48 hours, having legal counsel review the notice is wise. They can confirm whether the claim complies with DMCA requirements and advise on the best way to respond.\n\nBy treating the email carefully—verifying its authenticity, following your organization’s internal DMCA procedures, and consulting with the legal department—you’ll be better positioned to handle it appropriately and avoid potential pitfalls."

        "one-round response": "This email appears to be a promotional offer from TruGreen for lawn care services, but it’s always wise to proceed with caution when you receive unsolicited deals. Here’s how you can handle it:\n\n1. Verify the sender’s legitimacy:\n  • Check the sender’s email address and domain. Sometimes scammers use domains that look similar to a company’s official website (for example, “trugreen-offers.com” instead of the official “trugreen.com”).  \n  • If you’re unsure, instead of clicking any links in the email, manually type the company’s official website URL into your browser (or search for it) and compare the offer or call the customer service number listed there.\n\n2. Don’t click links or call numbers immediately:\n  • Hover over any links (without clicking) to see if their URLs seem consistent with what you expect from a legitimate corporate website.  \n  • Use known, verified contact information for TruGreen (e.g., from an official bill or their main website) in case you wish to inquire further.\n\n3. Evaluate your interest:\n  • If you’re already a TruGreen customer or thinking of a lawn care service, you might reach out directly to TruGreen using trusted contact details to confirm whether this offer is valid.  \n  • If you’re not interested or if something feels off, you can simply ignore or delete the email. Many legitimate companies include an unsubscribe link, which you can use if you don’t wish to receive future emails.\n\n4. Keep your personal information safe:\n  • Do not provide any personal or financial information in response to the email until you’ve verified it’s legitimate.\n  • Follow typical guidelines for handling promotional emails, especially if you weren’t expecting the offer.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can protect yourself from potential scams while ensuring that any offer you consider is genuine. In summary, verify the details independently, use caution with any links or phone numbers provided, and only proceed if you’re confident that the email is legitimate."

Do Not Act Immediately:\n • Avoid clicking on any links or calling any numbers directly from this email before you verify its legitimacy.\n • If you’re interested in extended coverage or preventive maintenance, consider reaching out to your vehicle’s manufacturer, dealership, or a trusted insurance provider to inquire about services.\n\n4.

        "one-round response": "Based on the content you shared, here are some considerations and steps to help you decide how to handle the email:\n\n1. Check if You Signed Up or Subscribed:  \n   • The email states, “You’re Receiving This Email Because: You signed up for dating tips or updates on eharmony.com.” If you remember signing up or providing your email through eHarmony, then the email is likely part of their regular marketing communications.  \n   • If you never signed up for communications from eHarmony, be more cautious.\n\n2. Verify the Sender Details:  \n   • Look at the sender’s address (support@eharmony.com) and the domain in the links (eharmony.com). These details match what you’d expect from a legitimate email from eHarmony.  \n   • If you’re unsure, you could manually type “eharmony.com” into your browser and log in (or search for contact information) rather than clicking on links directly from the email.\n\n3. Evaluate the Content:  \n   • The email includes information about eHarmony’s matching process, testimonials, and offers a free trial. It uses trusted language and claims (like the science-backed matching algorithm and survey data) typical for a dating site promotion.  \n   • Check if any details seem off or include unusual requests (like asking for sensitive personal or payment details immediately). In this case, nothing in the text appears immediately suspicious.\n\n4. Decide on Your Interest Level:  \n   • If you’re interested in the service or curious about their free trial, it’s safe to click the link—provided you’ve verified that the email comes from a legitimate source by double-checking the domain and sender information.  \n   • If you’re not interested or did not sign up deliberately, you can choose to ignore or unsubscribe from the mailing list using the provided link. Most reputable services include a clear way to unsubscribe.\n\n5. General Safety Reminders:  \n   • When receiving promotional emails, avoid clicking on embedded links if you’re not sure of their legitimacy. Instead, visit the official website directly by typing the URL in your browser.  \n   • If you suspect any part of the email is not as it appears, you could contact eHarmony’s customer support using a phone number or email address found on their official website (not just the ones in the email) to verify its authenticity.\n\nIn summary, if you did sign up for communications from eHarmony and you’re interested in their dating service, you can treat this as a regular promotional email. If you’re not interested or never signed up, you may choose to mark it as spam or unsubscribe. Always exercise caution and verify the details if anything seems out of the ordinary."

        "one-round response": "This email raises several red flags and should be handled with caution. Here are some steps you might take:\n\n1. Verify the Source Independently:\n • Look up the organization “Professional Who’s Who” or “Professional Who’s Who Registry” through a trusted search (using their official website or contact information from a reliable source) rather than using the contact details provided in the email.\n • Call or email your institution’s IT or security department to check if others have received similar communications or if they’ve been flagged as a potential scam.\n\n2. Do Not Click on Embedded Links or Open Attachments:\n • Avoid clicking on the “CONFIRM YOUR PROFILE” link until you’re sure the email is legitimate.\n • Be cautious with the attached PDF; even if it appears harmless, scanning it with antivirus software before opening might help identify potential risks.\n\n3. Check for Common Phishing Indicators:\n • Pressure to act quickly (“by 5:00 PM EST on [Date + 7 days]”) is a common tactic used in phishing emails.\n • The use of urgent language and promises of increased visibility can be designed to catch you off guard.\n • Look for spelling and grammatical inconsistencies or unusual formatting that might indicate the email is not from a trusted source.\n\n4. Verify Your Nomination via Known Channels:\n • If you believe you might have been nominated or if it aligns with your professional accomplishments, contact your professional society or relevant department at your organization directly to inquire about any such nomination – but do so using contact information you know is accurate.\n • Do not rely solely on the email’s provided details until you have confirmed that it is genuine.\n\n5. Check Email Headers:\n • If you’re comfortable doing so, examine the full email header for anomalies in the sender’s address and other routing information which might indicate it’s spoofed.\n\nSummary:\nWhile the email may be legitimate, its content and delivery tactics are consistent with known phishing or scam attempts. The best approach is to remain cautious, verify the nomination independently using trusted sources, and consult with your IT/security department before interacting further with the email.\n\nTaking these precautions can help protect your data and maintain your professional cybersecurity."
