The message seems generic and lacks personalization.\n\n2. **Unprofessional Language:** While the message attempts to mimic formal language, some phrases and structures are inconsistent with professional regulatory communications.\n\n3. **Urgency and Threats:** Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency and fear to pressure recipients into immediate action. Genuine regulatory bodies typically provide multiple official notices before escalating actions.\n\n4. **Suspicious Links:** The URL provided ([www.fake-cbirc.com](http://www.fake-cbirc.com)) is not an official government or regulatory domain. Always verify website URLs independently by checking official government sites.\n\n5. **Request for Payment:** Regulatory authorities usually do not request direct payments for verification or threaten individuals with penalties via email or text messages. Payment requests to personal or unofficial accounts are a strong indicator of fraud.\n\n6. **Non-standard Contact Methods:** Compliance officers at legitimate regulatory bodies are unlikely to use messaging services like QQ for official communication.\n\n7. **Contradictory Information:** The message warns against unofficial transfers while asking for one, which is contradictory and suspicious.\n\nGiven these signs, you should:\n\n- **Do Not Act on the Message:** Avoid clicking on any links, downloading attachments, or contacting the numbers provided.\n\n- **Verify with Official Sources:** If concerned, directly contact the CBIRC using official contact information found on their official website or through trusted government resources.\n\n- **Report the Scam:** Consider reporting the message to appropriate authorities or local law enforcement to help prevent others from falling victim to similar scams.\n\n- **Protect Personal Information:** Be cautious about sharing personal or financial information in response to unsolicited messages.

Legitimate organizations will not ask for upfront payments or to rush financial transactions in this manner.\n\n5. **Official Channels**: Use official communication channels to verify any procurement requests. Organizations like the Chinese People's Armed Police Force would likely use secure, internal communication methods, not text messages to personal phones.\n\n6. **Report the Message**: If you suspect a scam, report the message to local authorities or a cybersecurity organization.

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to seek your help with a time-sensitive matter involving a charitable trust.  \n\nMy late husband, Robert White, worked as an engineering contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for over 20 years until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution, which matured in 2007. The account holds approximately $7.5 million USD, including accrued interest. As his sole beneficiary, I was recently notified that the account has been classified as dormant. If no action is taken within the next 30 days, the funds will be forfeited to the bank under their unclaimed assets policy.  \n\nDue to my current circumstances‚ÄîI am undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital‚ÄîI am unable to travel or manage this process personally. My condition has left me unable to speak, and my physicians have advised that I have limited time remaining. I have already donated a significant portion of my estate (roughly $800,000 USD) to local churches and orphanages in Kinshasa. However, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to reputable international charities supporting widows, children‚Äôs education, and places of worship.  \n\nI am seeking a trustworthy individual to act as an authorized representative to reclaim these funds on my behalf and oversee their distribution to vetted organizations. Legal documentation from the bank (attached) confirms my status as the beneficiary, and a licensed attorney in Brussels, Mr. Daniel Lambert (+32 488 329 147 / d.lambert@brusselslegalassociates.be), stands ready to facilitate the transfer process.  \n\nWhile we have not met, I have prayed for guidance in identifying someone who shares my commitment to ethical stewardship. If you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact Mr. Lambert directly for further instructions. Due to privacy concerns (my late husband‚Äôs relatives are unaware of this arrangement), I ask that you treat this matter with discretion.  \n\nThank you for considering this request.

My husband and I were married for 11 years and devoted members of St. Mark‚Äôs Anglican Church in Ottawa, Canada. We were unable to have children, and after his death from cardiac complications, I chose to honor our vows by not remarrying.  \n\nDuring his career, my late husband deposited $10.5 million USD with a reputable financial institution in Lagos. This fund is currently held in a secured trust managed by Reserve Finance & Trust Corporation.

Per Proverbs 3:9, I believe this act will honor the Lord and my husband‚Äôs legacy, as his relatives are not believers and might misuse these resources.  \n\nTo proceed, I request your full name, address, and a contact number to share with my attorney, Mr. David Morgan of Morgan & Associates Law Firm in Ottawa.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

Here are several reasons why this email is likely a scam and how you should handle it:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Request**: You received an unsolicited email from someone you have no prior relationship with, particularly regarding a sensitive and substantial financial matter.\n\n2. **Sense of Urgency and Secrecy**: The email emphasizes the need for confidentiality and urgent action, which are common tactics used in scams to pressure recipients into acting without thinking.\n\n3. **Personal Information Request**: The scammer asks you to provide personal contact details. Legitimate organizations or individuals would not request sensitive information this way.\n\n4. **Compensation Promise**: The offer of a generous compensation for your cooperation is a typical tactic used to entice and distract from the implausibility of the request.\n\n5. **Vague and Dramatic Story**: The narrative is intricate yet vague and involves well-known public figures to add an element of legitimacy, which is another hallmark of scams.\n\nTo handle this email appropriately:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information.\n\n- **Do Not Open Attachments or Click Links**: If the email has any attachments or links, do not open or click them. These could contain malware or lead to phishing websites.\n\n- **Report the Email**: Consider reporting the email as spam or phishing to your email provider. Most email services have tools for this.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: After taking the above precautions, delete the email from your inbox.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the potential compromise of personal information, consider monitoring your financial accounts for any unusual activity and ensure your computer has updated antivirus software."

I am the widow of Major Stephen Johnson, who served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former Liberian President Charles Taylor during his administration. Following my husband‚Äôs tragic assassination by rebel forces last month, my family and I have been displaced to Dakar, Senegal, where we now reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nDue to the escalating conflict in Monrovia, my four daughters, my 23-year-old son David, and I were forced to flee our home with the assistance of government security personnel. Regrettably, all our properties and documentation were destroyed during the rebel incursion. Compounding this crisis, I suffer from chronic diabetes and hypertension, which has worsened under the stress of our displacement.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly secured US$7.2 million in a private trust account with the West African Trust & Finance Group here in Dakar. This fund was intended to safeguard our family‚Äôs future. However, due to legal restrictions tied to Liberia‚Äôs ongoing political crisis, I am unable to access or transfer these funds without a foreign collaborator. I require a trustworthy individual abroad to act as a designated beneficiary, enabling the release of these assets to a secure international account.  \n\nIn exchange for your assistance, I propose allocating 15% of the total sum to you, with the remainder reserved for resettling my family and covering urgent medical expenses. Strict confidentiality is paramount, as we remain under heightened scrutiny.  \n\nShould you be willing to assist, kindly respond to this email at your earliest convenience. For verification, I may be reached via phone at +221 77 234 5691 (Senegal) or through this secure ProtonMail address.  \n\nYour discretion and compassion in this matter would be a lifeline to my children and me.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nEmail: lydia.johnson.assist@protonmail.com  \nTel: +221 77 234 5691",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality regarding a deceased client and an unclaimed investment portfolio valued at six million United States Dollars (USD) under our institution‚Äôs management.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, the client (name withheld per privacy protocols) established a discretionary investment account with our private banking division. In mid-2004, the client instructed the liquidation of these funds for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Due to cross-border cash movement restrictions post-9/11, the funds were transferred to a licensed third-party security firm (name withheld for compliance reasons) specializing in high-net-worth asset custody.  \n\nThe client intended to retrieve the funds upon arrival in Europe later that year but passed away unexpectedly in Cannes, France, in November 2004. Despite exhaustive efforts by our internal investigations team and external affiliates, no next of kin was identified. Per private banking protocols, the account remains anonymous and inactive.  \n\nProposal:  \nRecent internal audits flagged this dormant account. As the sole custodian with knowledge of its existence, I propose a lawful resolution: I will facilitate your designation as the beneficiary via revised documentation, given your potential familial connection (identified through our audit trail). The security firm will release the funds to you upon my authorization.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Upon successful transfer, we will split the proceeds 60% to yourself and 40% to me for facilitating this discreetly.  \n- All interactions must remain confidential. Do not contact me via official channels (monitored per TQM policies). Use the dedicated contact details below.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply to dav.bryan@sifyprivate.co.uk or call +44 77 5342 1881 (secure line) within 72 hours.

Despite exhaustive efforts by the bank‚Äôs legal team to locate heirs‚Äîincluding liaising with French authorities and a private investigator‚Äîno legitimate claimants have surfaced.  \n\nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 20-year dormancy period are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. FCBN‚Äôs board has initiated proceedings to transfer these funds to the National Trust Fund for Humanitarian Relief by October 31, 2023, unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent this outcome, I propose nominating you as the legal beneficiary via a probate affidavit, retroactively designating you as Mr. Laurent‚Äôs business associate. My retained attorney, Mr. Femi Adebowale of Adebowale Legal Associates, has prepared the requisite documentation to substantiate this claim, including a notarized will and corporate partnership records.  \n\nUpon successful validation, the funds will be transferred to your nominated account via SWIFT. The disbursement will occur in two phases:  \n1. Initial Transfer: $10,000,000.00 (USD) within 7‚Äì9 business days of affidavit submission.  \n2. Remaining Balance: $26,000,000.00 (USD) following confirmation of the first transfer.  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 20% of the total ($7,200,000.00 USD).  \n- My Share: 65% (covers legal/administrative costs).  \n- Charitable Allocation: 10% to UNICEF and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res.  \n- Operational Expenses: 5% (bank fees, notary charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nKindly confirm your interest by reply, providing a secure contact number and fax for detailed documentation. All correspondence will remain confidential under attorney-client privilege.  \n\nFor immediate clarification, I may be reached at:  \n- Mobile: +234 706 555 0123  \n- Office: +234 1 277 5555 (Ext. 882)  \n- Email: jcabutti@fcbn.com.ng  \n- LinkedIn: [Joseph Cabutti ‚Äì FCBN Audit Division](https://linkedin.com/in/jcabutti-fcbn)  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to meet the statutory deadline.

        "one-round response": "This email appears to be a classic example of a scam, commonly known as a \"Nigerian Prince\" or \"419\" scam. Here are several red flags to note:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Proposal**: Legitimate business proposals from banks or financial institutions regarding large sums of money are not typically unsolicited. Receiving such a proposal out of the blue is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Too Good to Be True**: The promise of a large sum of money for little to no effort is a common scam tactic. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n3. **Urgency and Pressure**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure the recipient into making hasty decisions without thoroughly thinking them through.\n\n4. **Request for Personal Information**: The email asks for a secure contact number and fax, which might lead to further requests for sensitive personal and financial information.\n\n5. **Unusual Compensation Structure**: The distribution of funds, including a charitable allocation, is intended to create a veneer of legitimacy but is a suspicious and unnecessary detail in this context.\n\n6. **Professional Language and Formatting**: While the email is well-written and formatted, scammers often use such tactics to appear legitimate.\n\n7. **Contact from Unfamiliar Domains**: The use of an unfamiliar domain such as fcbn.com.ng is another red flag. Large institutions typically use well-known domains.\n\n**Appropriate Action:**\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid engaging with the sender at all. Responding can confirm to scammers that your email address is active, potentially leading to more scam attempts.\n\n- **Do Not Provide Personal Information**: Never share personal, financial, or sensitive information with unidentified or suspicious contacts.\n\n- **Mark as Spam/Phishing**: Use your email client‚Äôs options to mark the message as spam or phishing.\n\n- **Report the Scam**: Consider reporting the email to your email provider and relevant authorities in your region, such as consumer protection agencies or cybercrime units.\n\n- **Stay Informed**: Be aware of common scams and educate yourself on how fraudsters operate. This can help you recognize and avoid scams in the future. \n\nMaintaining a skeptical and vigilant approach toward unsolicited offers is key to protecting yourself from scams."

These scams typically promise a large sum of money in exchange for assistance with a legal or bureaucratic issue. They allure potential victims with the promise of a substantial financial reward but ultimately aim to obtain personal information or advance fees from the target under various pretenses.\n\nHere are several red flags from the email that indicate it is a scam:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Contact**: Receiving an unexpected email offering a large sum of money without previous contact is a common hallmark of scams.\n\n2. **Request for Confidentiality**: Scammers often emphasize confidentiality to prevent victims from seeking advice or sharing details with others who might recognize the scam.\n\n3. **Promise of Large Sums of Money**: Be cautious of emails promising a substantial financial reward for minimal effort.\n\n4. **International Element**: Many scams involve international elements, making legal recourse more difficult for victims.\n\n5. **Urgency**: The email's claim that this matter is time-sensitive is a common tactic to pressure recipients into making hasty decisions.\n\n6. **Lack of Professional Correspondence**: The email contains grammar and formatting issues that are not typical of professional or official communications.\n\n7. **Transfer of Rights**: The concept of easily transferring rights and access to large sums in the way described is unlikely and legally dubious.\n\n8. **Generic or Dubious Credentials**: The details about the sender and the organization are generic and can be fabricated easily.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle this is as follows:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or contacting the phone numbers provided.\n\n- **Do Not Provide Personal Information**: Never give out personal, banking, or financial details to unknown or unverified contacts.\n\n- **Report the Email**: Use your email provider's tools to mark the email as spam or phishing.

You will be designated as the lawful beneficiary to claim the funds.  \n2. BOA will facilitate the transfer to your nominated account after verification.  \n3. Compensation distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated to administrative/legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by BOA for charitable initiatives.  \n\nRequired Documentation:  \n- Bank account details (SWIFT/BIC code, IBAN, and branch address).  \n- Copy of government-issued identification (e.g., passport).  \n- A notarized affidavit confirming your status as a foreign beneficiary.  \n\nKindly respond within 10 business days to avoid account forfeiture.

        "one-round response": "The email you received is very likely a scam and part of a common type of fraud known as a \"Nigerian prince\" or \"advance-fee\" scam, despite not specifically originating from Nigeria. Here are some red flags and recommendations on how to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Contact**: Legitimate organizations do not contact individuals out of the blue to offer large sums of money, especially when you have no prior dealings with them.\n\n2. **Personal Details Request**: The email asks for sensitive personal information, such as bank account details and identification documents. Sharing such information can lead to identity theft or financial fraud.\n\n3. **Errors and Inconsistencies**: The email content may contain illogical statements or factual inaccuracies. Banks do not usually disclose details about accounts or their customers in emails to unknown individuals.\n\n4. **Urgency and Secrecy**: Scams often create a sense of urgency and require secrecy (\"Do not disclose to third parties\") to pressure victims into acting quickly without consulting others.\n\n5. **Too Good to Be True**: The offer of receiving a large sum of money for little to no effort is a classic sign of a scam.\n\nGiven these points, the appropriate way to handle this email is:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information.\n  \n- **Mark as Spam/Phishing**: Use your email provider's function to mark the email as spam or phishing, which can help prevent similar emails in the future.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: Once reported, delete the email from your inbox.\n\n- **Maintain Caution**: Be wary of similar emails in the future, and remember the common signs of scam emails.\n\nIf you're ever unsure about the legitimacy of an email, consult with a trusted friend, family member, or cybersecurity professional."

My name is Elizabeth Koffi-Annan, daughter of Mr. Koffi Anan, the former United Nations Secretary-General. I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I obtained your contact through a reputable international business directory while seeking a trustworthy partner abroad.  \n\nDue to my father‚Äôs prominent position, I must act discreetly regarding a personal matter. Several years ago, I deposited $22 million USD in a secured, coded account at the Bank of Africa in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. These funds were allocated to me privately and remain separate from my family‚Äôs affairs. However, transferring such a sum internationally without attracting scrutiny‚Äîparticularly while my father‚Äôs political legacy remains sensitive‚Äîrequires cautious collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this, I propose two mutual agreements:  \n1. Marriage of Convenience: A legal court wedding in your country to facilitate my relocation and fund transfer without familial interference.  \n2. Business Partnership: Your assistance in investing these funds into sustainable infrastructure or real estate ventures within your nation.  \n\nIn return, you would receive 20% of the total amount ($4.4 million USD) for your partnership and 10% ($2.2 million USD) to cover related expenses. My legal advisor, Mr. Jean-Luc B√©di√© (barrister.bedie@africalegal.ci), holds all documentation and will verify the account‚Äôs legitimacy upon your consent.  \n\nThis request is urgent, as I aim to finalize arrangements before my father‚Äôs associates inquire about the funds. Kindly reply with your direct phone number and availability for a brief call to discuss next steps. All communication must remain confidential to protect both parties.  \n\nI understand this is unconventional, but I trust you will treat my situation with empathy and professionalism.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nMiss Elizabeth Koffi-Annan  \nDaughter of H.E.

        "one-round response": "The email you've received is a classic example of a scam, often referred to as a \"Nigerian prince\" or advance-fee scam. Here are some reasons why this email should not be taken seriously or responded to:\n\n1. **Impersonation and False Claims**: The sender claims to be the daughter of a prominent international figure, which adds a false layer of credibility. Kofi Annan, the former UN Secretary-General, passed away in 2018, and it's extremely unlikely this story is genuine.\n\n2. **Financial Scam Signs**: The offer of a large sum of money in return for assistance is a typical red flag. Scammers will often ask for personal information or upfront payments for supposed legal or transfer fees, which would not be recovered.\n\n3. **Unusual Requests**: The proposal of a \"marriage of convenience\" is highly suspicious and inappropriate, signaling the scam's nonsensical and deceitful nature.\n\n4. **Generic and Poorly Written Content**: The email contains several generic elements and is poorly constructed, which are common traits in scam emails.\n\n5. **Legitimate Communications**: Legitimate business or legal matters would be conducted through proper channels and with verifiable contacts, not mysterious, unsolicited emails.\n\nTo handle this email appropriately:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Ignore the email and do not reply to it. Responding can confirm your email address as valid, potentially leading to further scam attempts.\n  \n- **Do Not Share Personal Information**: Do not provide personal details, financial information, or make any kinds of payments.\n\n- **Mark as Spam or Phishing**: Use your email provider's tools to mark the email as spam or phishing, which can help filter out similar scams in the future.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: Safely delete the email from your inbox.\n\n- **Report the Scam**: Consider reporting the scam to your email provider or relevant authorities, especially if you receive more of these types of emails.\n\nStaying informed and cautious about such scams is crucial to protect your personal and financial security."

I represent the estate of the late Mr. Nicolas Lef√®vre (1948‚Äì2001), a French national and former engineering consultant for TotalEnergies S.E. in West Africa.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Lef√®vre, his spouse, and their two children tragically perished in a collision outside Dakar. As court-appointed executor, I have spent 22 months conducting due diligence to locate surviving kin, including collaboration with French consular authorities and private investigators. To date, no legitimate heirs have been identified.  \n\nA fiduciary account holding ‚Ç¨14.7 million (approx. $15.8 million USD) remains at Banque R√©gionale de Commerce International (BRCI) under case BRCI/EST/2001-0452. Per Senegalese probate law, these assets will escheat to the state on November 15, 2023 unless a lawful beneficiary is confirmed.  \n\nGiven your professional standing and shared nationality with the deceased, I propose a strictly confidential arrangement:  \n- You would be documented as Mr. Lef√®vre‚Äôs designated beneficiary via a retroactive codicil.  \n- Funds would be disbursed through BRCI‚Äôs inheritance protocols, supervised by the Dakar Probate Court.  \n- Compensation: 55% allocated to you, 45% retained for legal fees, taxes, and administrative costs.  \n\nRequired for Compliance:  \n1.

Attempting to verify such details often leads to dead ends or untrustworthy sources.\n\nThe best course of action is:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information.\n- **Do Not Click Links**: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments, as they could be attempts to install malware.\n- **Block and Report**: Consider marking the email as spam and, if your service allows it, report the sender as phishing.\n- **Verify Independently**: If you're curious, you could independently verify the existence of the firm and individual through reliable sources, but direct contact based on the email should be avoided.\n\nRemember, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, a retiree based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I apologize for reaching out unsolicited, but I identified your credentials through a professional directory and believe you may be suited to assist with a time-sensitive charitable endeavor.  \n\nI am currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer, and my prognosis is limited. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (deceased 2002), was a logistics consultant who worked extensively in West Africa. During his career, he established a trust fund valued at ¬£11,800,000.00 (eleven million eight hundred thousand British pounds) through Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. This fund remains under legal review due to compliance complexities linked to his former engagements.  \n\nGiven my health and the lack of immediate heirs, I seek to allocate these resources to vetted organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: refugee aid, environmental conservation, and youth/widow support programs. Due to legal restrictions tied to the trust‚Äôs provenance, I require a fiduciary intermediary to oversee disbursement in accordance with international charitable guidelines.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Fund Origin: Legally documented inheritance (probate case #02-4786C, Puerto Rico Superior Court).  \n- Fiduciary Agent: Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. (London HQ).  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Structured philanthropic grant (no personal financial obligation required).  \n\nIf you are willing to collaborate on this initiative, kindly reply to acarlos.foundation@mailservice.pr within 72 hours to discuss due diligence steps. Confidentiality is paramount, as premature publicity could jeopardize the process.  \n\nThank you for considering this request.

        "one-round response": "It‚Äôs important to approach this email with caution as it displays several characteristics common in scams or phishing attempts. Here are some reasons to be skeptical and steps to take:\n\n1. **Unexpected Winning:** If you did not enter a lottery or promotion, it is likely fraudulent. Legitimate lotteries or promotions typically do not select winners from random email addresses without any prior entry.\n\n2. **Request for Confidential Information:** The email asks for sensitive information like banking details, which is a common red flag for scams.\n\n3. **Urgency and Secrecy:** Scammers often impose a tight deadline and emphasize confidentiality to pressure recipients into making hasty decisions.\n\n4. **Unfamiliar Source:** Verify the legitimacy of the organization and individuals mentioned. Check for official websites and contact them directly (using official contact details found independently, not those provided in the email) to confirm any claims.\n\n5. **Email Address and Language:** Check the email address carefully to see if it matches official domains from legitimate entities. Also, examine the language used; scams often contain spelling and grammar issues, although some are very polished.\n\n6. **Too Good to Be True:** Generally, if something seems too good to be true, it likely is. Large prize amounts with little to no effort on your part are suspicious.\n\n### Appropriate Steps to Handle the Email:\n\n- **Do Not Respond:** Avoid replying to the email or engaging with the sender in any way.\n\n- **Do Not Click Links or Open Attachments:** These could potentially lead to malicious sites or download malware onto your device.\n\n- **Research:** Look up \"Holland Casino Lotto Scam\" or similar terms online to see if others have reported similar emails.\n\n- **Report the Email:** Use your email provider's tools to report the email as spam or a phishing attempt.\n\n- **Delete the Email:** Once reported, delete the email to avoid accidental engagement in the future.\n\nRemember, legitimate lotteries and promotions will never ask you for sensitive personal or financial information via email. Always err on the side of caution in such scenarios."

My name is Dr. James Ngola, formerly the senior financial advisor to the late President Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I am writing to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive matter requiring urgent international collaboration.  \n\nFollowing the tragic assassination of President Kabila on January 16, 2001, I was entrusted with overseeing a portion of government funds generated through legal diamond exports under his administration. These funds, totaling $25 million USD, were stored in diplomatic containers and relocated to a private security vault in Accra, Ghana, under my supervision. Due to ongoing political instability in the region, I am now seeking a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the secure transfer and investment of these assets.  \n\nYour name was recommended to me by Mr. Thomas Whitaker, a mutual contact within the International Chamber of Commerce, who described you as a reputable professional with expertise in cross-border financial management. While the full context of this arrangement was withheld from him for security reasons, I trust his judgment implicitly.  \n\nHere is the proposed arrangement:  \n1. Asset Transfer: The funds (currently held as gold-backed certificates at GhanaSafe Securities Ltd.) will be transferred to a designated account under your name.  \n2. Compensation: You will retain 20% of the total sum ($5 million USD) for your assistance.  \n3. Investment: The remaining 75% ($18.75 million USD) will be allocated to joint ventures in your country, with your guidance.  \n4. Expenses: A 5% contingency fund ($1.25 million USD) will cover administrative costs, including legal fees and secure transport.  \n\nAll documentation‚Äîincluding certificates of deposit, customs clearance records, and diplomatic authorization letters‚Äîis prepared and verifiable. This transaction carries no legal risk, as the assets were formally declared to international auditors in 2000 and are unrelated to current DRC governance.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+233 55 712 3091) by Friday, October 27. I will then arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the paperwork and finalize logistics. Due to the time-sensitive nature of this matter, discretion is paramount.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former DRC Presidential Office)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233 55 712 3091  \n\nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

        "one-round response": "The email you received appears to be a classic example of a scam, often referred to as a \"Nigerian Prince\" or \"advance-fee\" scam. These scams typically involve someone claiming to have access to a large sum of money and offering you a significant portion in exchange for your assistance. The story is usually elaborate and includes elements like confidentiality, urgency, and potential profit to entice victims. Here‚Äôs why this email is likely a scam and what you should do:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Offer**: You received an unexpected message from someone you don't know, promising a large sum of money without any legitimate basis.\n\n2. **Too Good to Be True**: The offer of a large commission for relatively little effort is a common tactic used in scams.\n\n3. **Urgency and Confidentiality**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency and stress the need for secrecy to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking it through.\n\n4. **Personal Details and Contact Information**: The email asks for a response either through email or phone, which often leads to requests for your personal and bank details, and potentially upfront fees for various fabricated reasons.\n\n5. **Suspicious Context**: The background story involving political figures, international transactions, and secure vaults is designed to seem impressive but is typically unverifiable and fictitious.\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email, calling the number, or engaging with the sender in any form.\n\n- **Do Not Provide Personal Information**: Never share personal, financial, or banking information with unknown parties or in response to unsolicited requests.\n\n- **Mark as Spam/Phishing**: Use your email provider‚Äôs tools to mark the email as spam or a phishing attempt. This helps improve filters and can prevent future similar emails.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: Once reported and marked as spam, delete the email to avoid accidentally engaging with it later.\n\n- **Stay Informed**: Familiarize yourself with common signs of scams to protect yourself in the future. Regulatory bodies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or local consumer protection agencies often provide resources on recognizing and handling such scams.\n\nIf you ever feel unsure about a financial offer or request, it is always wise to consult with a trusted financial advisor or a professional before taking action."

My team recently identified an unclaimed account holding USD $15,000,000.00 under the name of Mr. Henrik Vogel, a German national who tragically perished with his family in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 disaster.  \n\nPer our internal audit, all documented next-of-kin designated by Mr. Vogel were also aboard the flight, leaving no legal heirs to claim the funds. Under Burkina Faso‚Äôs Financial Code (Article 14-B), unclaimed assets revert to the state treasury after five years unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.

Here are some indicators that suggest this email is not legitimate:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Proposal**: Legitimate financial institutions do not contact individuals out of the blue to propose business deals involving large sums of money.\n\n2. **Request for Personal Information**: The email asks for sensitive information such as your full name, contact information, bank account details, and a copy of your ID. Such details could be used for identity theft or other fraudulent activities.\n\n3. **Too Good to Be True**: The offer of a large sum of money for minimal effort is a common characteristic of scams.\n\n4. **Urgency and Secrecy Emphasis**: Scammers often create a false sense of urgency and emphasize confidentiality to pressure victims into acting quickly without thinking.\n\n5. **Suspicious Email and Contact Details**: There is no easy way to verify the authenticity of the email address or phone number from which the email was sent. Legitimate communications from financial institutions typically come from official, verifiable sources.\n\n6. **Grammar and Formatting Issues**: Many scam emails contain inconsistent formatting and grammatical errors, though this may not always be apparent.\n\nHere's how you should handle the situation:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid engaging with the sender in any way. Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information.\n\n- **Do Not Click Links or Open Attachments**: Links or attachments in scam emails can contain malware or lead to phishing websites.\n\n- **Report the Email as Spam or Phishing**: Use your email provider‚Äôs features to report the message. This helps prevent further attempts to you and others.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: Once reported, delete the email from your inbox to reduce the risk of accidentally interacting with it in the future.\n\nIf you're ever uncertain about the legitimacy of a message, it's a good practice to seek advice from someone you trust before taking any action."

I am reaching out to you under strict confidentiality to propose a legitimate business opportunity that requires your cooperation.  \n\nDuring a routine audit review, I identified a dormant account with a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four Dollars, Twenty-Two Cents). The account belongs to Mr. Pierre Johnson, a German national and former client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a motor accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate his next of kin or legal heirs, no beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nAs the account holder left no will and has no documented relatives, our institution is legally obligated to transfer the funds to a verified beneficiary or release them to the state after a statutory period. To prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating with you to process a lawful claim as Mr. Johnson‚Äôs designated next of kin. All documentation, including the death certificate, account records, and legal affidavits, has been prepared to facilitate this process.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds will be transferred through our affiliate, Citibank Online (Madrid Branch), directly to your nominated account.  \n- Continental Bank‚Äôs internal approval is required to initiate the transfer, which I will oversee.  \n- The process adheres to international banking protocols and carries no financial risk to you.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via reply.

Tragically, Mr. Duke, along with his spouse and only child, passed away in an aviation incident on January 30, 2000.  \n\nUnder the UK Financial Conduct Authority‚Äôs Dormant Account Policy (Section 4.2), beneficiaries or next of kin must claim such funds within a 25-year period.

Legitimate institutions would not request personal data in such a manner.\n\n3. **Urgency**: The email tries to create a sense of urgency by giving you a deadline to respond, which is a common tactic used by scammers to pressure you into making a quick decision without due diligence.\n\n4. **Unusual Profit Sharing**: The offer to split the funds, especially with the bank retaining 40% for administrative and legal fees, is highly suspicious and not standard practice.\n\n5. **Email Address and Contact Details**: The email address provided doesn't appear to conform to standard Barclays email domains, and using a personal name in a professional context can be suspect.\n\n6. **Grammar and Formatting**: Scammers often use language that might seem formal but include subtle errors or unusual formatting, which may not align with professional communication standards of reputable banks.\n\n7. **Too Good to Be True**: Offers involving large sums of money for minimal effort are almost always scams.\n\nHere's how to handle it:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid engaging with the sender in any way.\n- **Do Not Share Personal Information**: Never send copies of your ID, banking details, or any personal information to the sender.\n- **Report the Email**: Consider reporting the email as spam/phishing to your email provider. You can also forward it to Barclays Bank's fraud department (especially via their website) for their awareness.\n- **Delete the Email**: Once you've reported it, delete the email to avoid any accidental interaction in the future.\n\nStaying vigilant and scrutinizing unsolicited offers, especially those involving money, is key to protecting yourself from scams."

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the late Head of State of Nigeria (1993‚Äì1998). I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Association of Commerce, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of assisting with a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing my husband‚Äôs passing in 1998, I have faced sustained pressure from governmental authorities seeking to confiscate assets linked to his estate. Recent audits have uncovered approximately $700 million in overseas accounts, which the current administration claims were improperly acquired. While I dispute these allegations, my ability to challenge them is restricted due to ongoing surveillance and travel restrictions imposed on me.  \n\nCurrently, $35 million USD is held in a private security vault under a confidential agreement with a European fiduciary firm. Due to my legal status, I am unable to access these funds directly. I seek your assistance in transferring this amount to a secure bank account under your name. Upon successful completion, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million) as compensation, with the remainder allocated to my relocation and legal defense.  \n\nMy family‚Äôs legal counsel, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu (aliyu_legal@abachalawfirm.ng; +234 809 876 5432), will coordinate all documentation and logistics. Due to monitoring of my communications, I request that you respond directly to this email (mariam.abacha@mariamabacha.net) and copy barrister.aliyu@abachalawfirm.ng to initiate proceedings.  \n\nThis request is made in strict confidence. Should you decline, I ask only for your discretion, as publicity would exacerbate my current situation. No financial risk is involved, as all transfer fees and legal safeguards have been prearranged.  \n\nI await your prompt reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nHajia Mariam Abacha  \n‚Äî‚Äî  \nContact Assurance:  \n- Primary Email: mariam.abacha@mariamabacha.net  \n- Legal Counsel: Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu | +234 809 876 5432 | barrister.aliyu@abachalawfirm.ng  \nNote: For security reasons, avoid mentioning this correspondence via phone or unsecured channels.",

Scammers often use lottery wins to entice recipients.\n\n2. **Personal Information Request**: The email requests personal details, such as a copy of your ID. Legitimate organizations would not typically ask for sensitive information via email.\n\n3. **Sense of Urgency**: The requirement to act quickly within 48 hours and stressing confidentiality are common tactics used to pressure recipients into responding without thinking.\n\n4. **Contact Details and Domain**: The email comes from an unfamiliar domain (@hollandcasino-promo.nl), and Holland Casino's official domain is www.hollandcasino.nl. Always verify the legitimacy of email domains and contact details independently.\n\n5. **Lack of Personalization**: The email doesn't address you by name, which is often a sign of a generic phishing attempt.\n\n6. **Spelling and Grammar**: The email is relatively well-written, but professionals in phishing scams have become adept at mimicking legitimate communications.\n\n7. **Too Good to Be True**: Winning a substantial amount of money without participation is typically too good to be true.\n\n**Appropriate Actions**:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid contacting the numbers or email addresses provided in the email.\n  \n- **Do Not Share Personal Information**: Refrain from sending any personal details or IDs.\n\n- **Report and Delete**: Report the email as phishing to your email provider and delete it.\n\n- **Verify with Official Sources**: If you want to confirm its legitimacy, contact Holland Casino directly using contact information from their official website, not the details in the email.\n\nBeing cautious with such emails helps protect you from potential scams and identity theft."

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your collaboration in resolving a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing President Kabila‚Äôs tragic assassination on January 16, 2001, during a private meeting to review proceeds from state-managed diamond exports, I was entrusted with overseeing $100 million USD in diplomatic assets. These funds, stored in three sealed diplomatic containers, were routed through Zimbabwe and later dispersed to ensure their security during the ensuing political instability.  \n\nA portion of these funds, amounting to $25 million USD, was converted to gold reserves and deposited under my authority with Accra Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed security firm in Ghana, where I currently reside as a political refugee. Due to my status, I require a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the transfer of these assets into a secure international account for future investment.  \n\nYour name was recommended by Mr. Daniel Clarke, a member of the International Chamber of Commerce based in Accra, who attested to your professionalism and discretion. While he is unaware of the specifics, he confirmed your reliability for such a critical undertaking.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will act as the beneficiary of the funds, enabling their transfer to your account.  \n2. Upon successful clearance, you will retain 20% ($5 million USD) as compensation.  \n3. The remaining 75% will be allocated to long-term investments in your country under your guidance.  \n4. A 5% reserve will cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nAll documentation, including certificates of deposit, diplomatic seals, and ownership affidavits, is secured. The funds carry no public record, as they were designated for presidential use and bypassed official channels.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly respond to this email or contact me directly at +233-27-195-3892 (Ghana) within 48 hours. I will arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the documentation and finalize the transfer. Your discretion is paramount, as premature disclosure could jeopardize this transaction.  \n\nI look forward to your urgent reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former)  \nOffice of the President, DRC (1997‚Äì2001)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233-27-153-2915  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

My name is Mrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi, widow of the late Dr. Jonas Savimbi, former leader of the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA). After years of silence, I am compelled to seek your assistance due to extraordinary circumstances.  \n\nMy husband, who survived numerous attempts on his life, was tragically killed in 2002 during a clash with Angolan government forces. Before his passing, he secured USD 16,400,000.00 (Sixteen Million Four Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in the form of precious assets, deposited with a private security firm in South Africa. This fund was accrued through legitimate sales of gold and diamonds during his leadership.  \n\nFollowing his death, my family and I faced relentless persecution. While my eldest son and I remain under house arrest in Angola, my younger son, Peter Savimbi, escaped to South Africa under political asylum. Regrettably, South African law restricts refugees from conducting major financial transactions, leaving him unable to claim the assets.  \n\nI am reaching out to you‚Äîguided by faith and necessity‚Äîto request your partnership. We propose appointing you as the legal beneficiary to facilitate the transfer. In return, you will retain 30% of the total sum for your cooperation, with the remaining 70% allocated to securing my family‚Äôs future upon our release.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact my son directly via:  \nEmail: petersavimbi8@webmail.co.za  \nAlternate Email: petersavimbi5@webmail.co.za  \nPhone: +27 72 434 0319 (South Africa)  \n\nRequired Details for Documentation:  \n1.

Here are some reasons why you should not pay attention to it:\n\n1. **Unusual Request**: Legitimate financial transactions involving large sums of money do not happen via email from unknown individuals asking for personal information.\n\n2. **Storytelling and Urgency**: The email typically contains an elaborate story and an urgent request to help transfer money, which is a common tactic used by scammers to lure victims.\n\n3. **Personal Information Request**: The email asks for personal information, which can be used for identity theft.\n\n4. **Too Good to Be True Offer**: Promising a large sum of money for minimal assistance is a red flag. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n5. **Unverified Details**: The institutions and contacts mentioned are likely fabricated or misrepresented, and there is no way to verify their authenticity.\n\nHere's how you should handle the email:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information.\n\n- **Mark as Spam**: Mark the email as spam or junk in your email client to help filter similar messages in the future.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: Remove it from your inbox to avoid any future temptation to engage with it.\n\n- **Report the Scam**: Consider reporting the scam to your email provider, local authorities, or applicable government agencies dealing with cybercrime.\n\nBy taking these steps, you help protect yourself and others from falling victim to such scams."

I could not do this because of the situation in the \nworld today not being sure of your reaction.\n \nI am Jones Martin, a \nConsultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese \nBusinessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company \nin Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for \ntermination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and \nthe oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid \npayment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of \nUS Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service IRS. \n \nA special \narrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with \nJapanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to \nterminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with \nan arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they \nprepared and handed over to The banker.\n \nI was directly involved, well \npaid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal.

My name is Jones Martin, an independent financial consultant based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive matter involving an unclaimed asset deposit of US$25,000,000.00 held under a diplomatic storage arrangement in Europe.  \n\nBackground of the Transaction:  \nIn 2003, I was contracted by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi) to facilitate a private equity partnership with a Venezuelan oil conglomerate. The investment matured in 2005, and both parties agreed to liquidate the funds in cash to avoid substantial IRS tax liabilities. A senior banker at Mizuhara Trust Bank (New York branch) coordinated the withdrawal and discreet transfer of the funds to a secure storage facility in Luxembourg, registered under a pseudonym.  \n\nThe assets were stored as \"family valuables\" to comply with logistics protocols, with full documentation (certificates, access codes, and keys) entrusted to me. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, leaving the deposit dormant and legally unresolved.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nThe storage facility‚Äôs management has issued repeated notifications since December 2023 to finalize the retrieval process. As the sole surviving executor, I am legally authorized to appoint a designated beneficiary to claim the assets. Due to geopolitical sensitivities and strict confidentiality requirements, I require a trustworthy partner to act as the beneficiary under a pre-negotiated agreement.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n- You will be registered as the temporary beneficiary via a notarized power of attorney (pre-drafted in 2005).  \n- The storage facility in Luxembourg will release the assets upon verification of your identity and my authorization.  \n- A 7% commission (US$1,750,000.00) will be allocated to you for your assistance, with the remainder repatriated to the investor‚Äôs estate.  \n\nThis process is structured to comply with all applicable regulations, and I will provide full documentation for due diligence. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf willing to proceed, kindly confirm your interest by reply email or contact me directly at +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica) or jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com. I will arrange a secure call to discuss timelines and logistics.  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to prevent asset forfeiture.

Generally, legitimate financial matters would not be handled in this manner, especially without prior knowledge or involvement.\n\n2. **Lack of Personalization**: These scams often address the recipient in vague terms without specific personal details, though this example uses a common name (\"David Carter\") that might be used to target a broad audience.\n\n3. **Urgency and Confidentiality**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency and demand confidentiality to prevent you from verifying the information with others.\n\n4. **Request for Personal Information or Money**: Though not explicitly stated, such scams usually lead to demands for personal information or advance payments to cover \"fees\" or \"taxes\" before you can receive any funds.\n\n5. **Unusual Story**: The story about assets being stored in a diplomatic storage arrangement and the involvement of deceased individuals sounds implausible and is typical of scam narratives to make the situation seem unique and complex.\n\n6. **Anonymous Email and Location**: The use of a free email account (ProtonMail) and a request to call an international phone number are also common in scams to make tracing and accountability difficult.\n\n**Appropriate Steps to Handle the Email:**\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or engaging in any conversation, as this could confirm your email address is active and make you a target for further scams.\n\n- **Do Not Share Personal Information**: Never provide personal information, financial details, or any form of payment to unknown parties contacting you in this way.\n\n- **Report the Email**: Use your email provider's tools to report the email as spam or phishing. If you want to take further action, you can report such scams to relevant authorities, like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: After reporting, delete the email to avoid accidental future engagement.\n\nRemaining vigilant and skeptical of unsolicited messages promising large sums of money is vital for protecting yourself from scams."

I am reaching out to propose a confidential and time-sensitive business arrangement, which was referred to you through a trusted contact at the Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national and longtime resident of Nigeria, Mr. Emre Yƒ±lmaz (deceased), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million.

To date, no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to forfeiture if unclaimed. To resolve this, my colleagues and I propose the following:  \n1. You will act as a designated beneficiary, providing documentation (passport, bank details, etc.) to establish a legitimate claim.  \n2. We will handle all internal approvals and reclassify the account for disbursement within 10 business days.  \n3. For your assistance, you will retain 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million). The remainder will cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nKey Points:  \n- Confidentiality: All communication will occur via secure channels (email, encrypted fax).  \n- Risk Mitigation: This process adheres strictly to internal protocols to ensure no future liabilities.  \n- Urgency: Immediate action is required to prevent the account‚Äôs escheatment to the state.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nKindly confirm your interest by replying to this email or contacting me directly at:  \n- Phone: +234 809 765 4321 (WhatsApp/Signal)  \n- Fax: +234 700 555 0199  \n- Email: m.chime@ubagroup-ng.com  \n\nUpon your confirmation, I will provide a detailed step-by-step guide and document templates.

        "one-round response": "The email you received appears to be a classic example of an advance-fee scam, commonly known as a \"Nigerian Prince\" or \"419\" scam. These scams typically involve promising a large sum of money in return for assistance, with the scammers ultimately seeking to extract personal information, advance fees, or other financial information from the victim.\n\nHere are the reasons why this email is likely a scam:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Proposal**: Legitimate businesses or banks do not approach individuals with unsolicited proposals to transfer large sums of money.\n\n2. **Confidential and Time-Sensitive Requests**: Scammers often emphasize urgency and confidentiality to pressure victims into quick decisions without ample consideration.\n\n3. **Personal Information**: The email asks for sensitive personal information, such as your passport and bank details, which can be used for identity theft.\n\n4. **Too Good to Be True**: Offers of large sums of money with little effort from your end tend to be fraudulent.\n\nTo handle this situation appropriately, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid engaging with the sender in any form. Responding may expose you to further fraud attempts.\n\n2. **Do Not Provide Personal Information**: Refrain from sharing any personal or financial information.\n\n3. **Mark as Spam or Report**: Use your email service's features to mark this email as spam or phishing.\n\n4. **Remain Vigilant**: Be cautious of similar future emails and educate yourself on common online scams to avoid falling victim.\n\n5. **Consider Reporting**: If you're interested, you can report the scam to relevant authorities or organizations dedicated to internet fraud prevention, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States or Scamwatch in Australia.\n\nOverall, exercise caution and skepticism with unsolicited emails that promise large sums of money or require your personal details."

I am writing to you in my capacity as the legal representative of the late Mr. Neil Frazer, a French national and former private contractor for Shell Petroleum Development Company in Senegal.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Frazer, his spouse, and their three children tragically perished in a vehicular accident near Dakar. Despite exhaustive efforts over the past two years‚Äîincluding liaising with the French Consulate, Interpol, and municipal registries‚Äîno next of kin or valid beneficiaries have been identified for Mr. Frazer‚Äôs estate.  \n\nPrior to his passing, Mr. Frazer held a secured trust account with FinanceSecurity Group (FSG), now valued at $21,000,000 USD. FSG has issued a final notice (Ref: FSG/EST/DAK-1129) requiring the appointment of a beneficiary within 30 business days to avoid forfeiture of the funds under Senegalese unclaimed asset regulations.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose a confidential arrangement wherein you would be presented as the designated beneficiary. All requisite legal documentation, including notarized affidavits and probate court approvals, has been prepared to substantiate this claim. Upon successful transfer, the proceeds would be disbursed as follows:  \n- 60% allocated to my firm for legal fees, administrative costs, and fiduciary obligations.  \n- 40% allocated to you for your cooperation and discretion.  \n\nThis process adheres strictly to Senegalese civil law (Code des Obligations Civiles et Commerciales, Art. 721-725) and international anti-money laundering protocols. Your involvement entails no financial obligation or travel.  \n\nTo initiate proceedings, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Name: (e.g., Pierre Dupont)  \n2.

I was hired by a Japanese \nBusinessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company \nin Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for \ntermination in January 2005.

My name is Jones Martin, a licensed financial consultant and broker based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive opportunity involving the collection of a US$25,000,000.00 asset held under a confidential arrangement.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, I was engaged by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi, now deceased) to facilitate an offshore oil investment partnership with a Venezuelan energy firm. The agreement concluded in 2005, with both parties opting to liquidate the investment in cash to minimize tax liabilities. A structured withdrawal was coordinated through a senior banker at Mitsuhashi Trust Bank (New York Branch) to transfer the funds to a secure vault facility in Luxembourg, managed by EuroSafe Financial Holdings.  \n\nThe assets were registered under a pseudonym with a bonded power of attorney, ensuring legal transferability. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina (August 2005), leaving the retrieval documents (storage certificates, access codes, and keys) solely in my custody.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nEuroSafe has issued repeated reminders since December 2023 to finalize the collection process. As the sole surviving authorized party, I am legally obligated to identify a collaborator to assume ownership via the pre-established power of attorney. This requires:  \n1. A notarized affidavit confirming your role as the beneficiary.  \n2. A joint visit to EuroSafe‚Äôs Luxembourg facility to validate credentials.  \n\nTerms & Assurance:  \n- Legality: All documentation complies with international fiduciary regulations.  \n- Confidentiality: A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be executed prior to further disclosure.  \n- Compensation: You will retain 30% of the retrieved funds for your participation; my fee is derived from the remaining portion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply promptly to jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm or call +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica office) to schedule a secure videoconference. Due to the sensitivity of this matter, I regret that I cannot disclose further details publicly.  \n\nKindly treat this correspondence with utmost discretion.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nLicensed Financial Consultant  \nMartin & Associates Consultancy Ltd.  \n12 Harbour Street, Kingston, Jamaica  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198 | Email: jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm  \n\nNote: All identifiers (names, institutions) have been altered for confidentiality.

After reviewing your profile, I felt compelled to reach out, as your background suggests you may be well-suited to assist with a sensitive matter.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Jonathan Edmond, was a prominent political figure in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. Before his tragic assassination in 2019, he secured a sum of $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a private security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son, Emmanuel, and I are unable to access these funds directly. We seek to relocate this capital abroad for safekeeping and investment in stable markets.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $8.5M USD held in a bonded consignment under diplomatic protocols.  \n- Objective: Transfer the funds to a trusted partner outside Africa to establish long-term investments.  \n- Proposed Sectors: Real estate development, transportation infrastructure, and hospitality (e.g., luxury hotels).  \n\nWe require a representative to act as the legal consignee for the transfer. The security firm will handle all logistics, including diplomatic clearance and shipment of documentation to your address. In exchange for your assistance, we propose allocating 20% of the total amount ($1.7M USD) to you, with the remainder earmarked for joint ventures in your region.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and availability.  \n2. Provide a secure mailing address to initiate the transfer process.  \n3. Collaborate on drafting an investment plan for the remaining funds.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this matter, I would be grateful for your discretion.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account.

My name is David Bryan, and I serve as a Senior Portfolio Manager within the Private Wealth division.  \n\nIn 2003, a client (whose identity remains protected per privacy protocols) established a US$6,000,000 investment portfolio through our institution. This arrangement proceeded without incident until November 2004, when the client instructed us to liquidate the entirety of the holdings for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Following strict compliance protocols, we coordinated with an authorized affiliate agency to facilitate the transfer through Nordic SafeGuard Solutions ‚Äì a discreet financial logistics firm specializing in high-value transactions for institutional clients.  \n\nThe client indicated plans to retrieve these funds personally within days of their deposit. However, no further contact was established. In June 2022, Nordic SafeGuard alerted us to the account‚Äôs prolonged dormancy. Subsequent investigations revealed the client had succumbed to cardiac arrest in Cannes, France, in May 2022. French authorities confirmed the identity through dental records, though no next of kin was listed in official documentation.  \n\nOur internal audit confirms you were identified through beneficiary tracing efforts as a potential familial connection. Strict anonymity protocols prevent me from disclosing specifics via conventional channels, hence this direct communication.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs sole custodian of the transaction codes required to release the funds, I propose establishing you as the legal beneficiary through documented kinship ‚Äì a process requiring discreet collaboration.

There are several red flags that suggest this is a fraudulent attempt to deceive you:\n\n1. **Unexpected Contact**: You haven't mentioned any prior connection to this individual or institution.\n\n2. **Vague Details**: The email lacks specific details regarding the supposed deceased client, which is typical in scams. Real institutions provide verifiable information.\n\n3. **Unusual Proposal**: The suggestion to split the funds (60% to you and 40% to them) is suspicious and not how legitimate financial or legal matters are handled.\n\n4. **Pressure and Urgency**: The email emphasizes urgency by stating the offer will \"self-retract\" if not answered within 14 days. Scams often use pressure tactics.\n\n5. **Confidential Communication**: Instructions to avoid using official channels and to keep the matter confidential are common in phishing attempts.\n\n6. **Suspicious Communication Channels**: The use of private emails (such as a \"pmail\" address), Signal, or WhatsApp instead of official corporate communication systems is highly questionable.\n\nTo handle this email appropriately:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Do not reply to the email or engage with the sender in any way.\n\n- **Do Not Provide Personal Information**: Never share personal, financial, or sensitive information with unknown or unverified contacts.\n\n- **Report the Email**: Consider reporting it to your email provider as phishing or spam.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: After reporting, delete the email from your inbox.\n\nIf you're ever uncertain about the legitimacy of an email, consider consulting with someone knowledgeable about scams or reach out to official sources directly (e.g., contacting the legitimate institution in question using verified contact information found through an official website or directory)."

I decided to contact you after I went through my fathers file. \nHence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.\n\nMy name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy \nfarmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my \ncountry, Movement for Democratic Change MDC. Our wicked President Robert  \nmugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have \nbecome his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and \na moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of \nbrutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.\n\nHere is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  \ndeposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars US$10,000,000.00 with a \nsecurity company,The money was deposited as a gemprecious stone in a metal \ntrunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company \norganization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money. In view of this, The monetary policylaw does not allow such \ninvestment by an asylum seeker or refugee.

My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent agricultural entrepreneur and senior member of Zimbabwe‚Äôs Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am reaching out to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, which I will explain briefly.  \n\nFollowing my father‚Äôs assassination by agents of the current government, I was forced to flee Zimbabwe for my safety. Prior to his death, my father secured USD $10,000,000 in the form of precious gemstones within a sealed trunk, deposited with a private security firm in Pretoria, South Africa. These funds were intended for agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini, including machinery procurement and farm development.  \n\nRegrettably, the Zimbabwean government has frozen all family assets and bank accounts, leaving me unable to access these resources. Due to my status as an asylum seeker, South African financial regulations (Section 12B of the Financial Regulations Act) prohibit me from directly claiming or investing such funds. This is why I require a trusted partner abroad to act as the legal recipient.  \n\nProposal:  \n- You would facilitate the transfer of the trunk to your country as the designated consignee.  \n- Upon successful retrieval, 15% ($1,500,000) will be allocated to you for your assistance.  \n- The remainder will fund my relocation and agricultural ventures, with potential opportunities for further collaboration.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the security company has imposed a 30-day deadline before imposing additional storage fees. All documentation, including the deposit certificate and my father‚Äôs will, is prepared for verification.  \n\nConfidentiality is critical, as any disclosure could jeopardize both our safety. For further discussion, please reply to this email or contact me at:  \n- Email: mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au  \n- Phone: +27 63 578 9012 (via secure messaging app Signal, if preferred).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this request and am prepared to provide any evidence needed to establish trust.

These scams often involve someone claiming to need assistance transferring a large sum of money, promising a significant financial reward in return. The goal is typically to obtain personal information, upfront fees, or bank details from the recipient.\n\nHere are a few reasons why this email is suspicious:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Offer**: It's unlikely for a stranger to contact you out of the blue with such a significant financial proposal.\n\n2. **Urgency and Pressure**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into making quick decisions without careful consideration.\n\n3. **Too Good to Be True**: The promise of a large financial gain for minimal effort is a common red flag in scams.\n\n4. **Request for Confidentiality**: By urging you to keep the matter confidential, the scammer aims to prevent you from seeking advice or verification from others.\n\n5. **Personal and Financial Information**: Eventually, scams like these may ask for personal information, advance fees, or bank details as part of the \"transfer\" process.\n\nTo handle this email appropriately:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or communicating with the sender in any way.\n\n- **Do Not Click Any Links**: If there are any links or attachments within the email, do not click or download them, as they could contain malware.\n\n- **Mark as Spam or Junk**: Use your email provider's tools to mark the email as spam or junk. This can help filter similar emails in the future.\n\n- **Report the Scam**: If you want to take further action, consider reporting the email to local authorities or to organizations that handle cybercrime and fraud, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your country's equivalent.\n\n- **Maintain Caution**: Be wary of similar emails in the future and use this experience to remain vigilant against potential scams.\n\nIt's always good practice to be skeptical of unsolicited emails promising substantial rewards for little effort."

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. My late husband, Robert White, worked as an expatriate engineer with Chevron in Kenya for over two decades until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution (Banc Europ√©en), which currently holds approximately $7.5 million USD (principal plus accrued interest).  \n\nSince my husband‚Äôs death, this account has remained dormant. Recently, the bank notified me that if the funds are not claimed or re-activated by December 15, 2024, they will be forfeited under their dormant account policy. Regrettably, I am unable to complete this process myself due to critical health circumstances. I am currently undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital and have been advised that my condition is terminal.  \n\nWhile I have donated a significant portion of my estate (including property and assets valued at ~$800,000 USD) to local charities and orphanages in Kenya and Kinshasa, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to international faith-based organizations, homeless shelters, and medical missions. My husband‚Äôs relatives, who are not aligned with our Christian values, have repeatedly attempted to seize control of these assets, leaving me unable to trust them with this responsibility.  \n\nWhy I Am Reaching Out to You:  \nThe bank requires a trustee to legally authorize the reactivation and transfer of these funds to verified charities. As a member of my church‚Äôs outreach network, your name was provided to me as a potential individual of integrity who may assist in this matter. If you are willing, I will instruct my attorney, Mr. Daniel Clarke (Clarke & Partners Legal Associates, Brussels), to liaise with you. He will provide:  \n1. A notarized authorization letter naming you as the temporary trustee.  \n2. Bank contact details and transfer protocols.  \n3. Documentation verifying the legitimacy of the account and my medical condition.  \n\nDue to my inability to speak (a result of my treatment) and concerns about family interference, all communication must remain via email. I sincerely apologize for the abrupt nature of this request and understand if you are unable to assist. However, time is of the essence to prevent the funds from being seized.  \n\nShould you agree to help, kindly respond to this email, and my attorney will promptly initiate the process. May God guide your decision.  \n\nWith gratitude,  \nSandra White  \nNairobi General Hospital, Room 214B  \n(Direct correspondence: sandra.white_trust@pmail.com)  \n\nNote: This request is bound by confidentiality.

It has many characteristics of a common type of scam known as an advance-fee fraud, which often involves a compelling story and a large sum of money that supposedly needs to be transferred abroad, requiring your assistance. Here's how to handle it:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Do not reply to the email. Engaging with the sender can lead to further attempts to extract personal information or even money from you.\n\n2. **Do Not Provide Personal Information**: Never share personal, financial, or banking information in response to unsolicited emails.\n\n3. **Look for Red Flags**: Notice elements like spelling and grammar mistakes, generic greetings, and the urgency and secrecy around the financial transaction. Scammers rely on pressing you to act quickly without thinking.\n\n4. **Ignore Requests for Money**: If the scam progresses, the sender might request you to pay a fee or share your bank details to help transfer the funds, which is a clear indicator of a scam.\n\n5. **Report the Email**: You should report the email to your email provider as a phishing attempt. Additionally, consider reporting it to relevant authorities or organizations that handle fraud, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the U.S. or the equivalent in your country.\n\n6. **Educate Yourself and Others**: Familiarize yourself with common scam tactics to help avoid future traps and inform relatives and friends to prevent them from falling victim to such scams.\n\nOverall, the safest course of action is to delete the email and take no further steps with it."

I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University.  \n\nDue to my father‚Äôs esteemed position and ongoing diplomatic obligations, I am seeking a trustworthy overseas partner to assist me in discreetly relocating a personal inheritance of $22 million USD currently held in a secured account at ECOBANK (C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire). This fund was allocated to me privately and must remain confidential to avoid implicating my family during my father‚Äôs transition from office.  \n\nI propose a partnership wherein you would act as both my spouse (to legitimize the transfer under marital provisions) and business investor. This arrangement would allow us to:  \n1. Legally transfer the funds to your account.  \n2. Establish a joint venture (e.g., real estate, agriculture, or manufacturing) in your country.  \n3. Formalize our marriage via a civil ceremony to expedite immigration processes.  \n\nFor your support, you will receive 20% of the total sum ($4.4 million), with an additional 10% allocated for administrative expenses. My family‚Äôs legal advisor, Mr. Kwame Osei, will handle all documentation to ensure compliance with international banking regulations.  \n\nConfidentiality is paramount. Please reply with your:  \n- Full name and residential address  \n- Direct contact number  \n- Preferred method of communication (email/phone)  \n\nOnce confirmed, I will travel to your country to finalize arrangements.  \n\nContact Details:  \nüìß Email: elizabeth.anan@mailservice.com  \nüìû Tel: +233 55 123 4567 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred)  \n\nI trust in your discretion and look forward to your urgent response.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMiss Elizabeth Anan  \nDaughter of H.E.

        "one-round response": "This email is a scam and should not be taken seriously. It exhibits several hallmarks of a common type of fraud known as a \"Nigerian Prince\" or advance-fee scam. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Improbable Scenario**: The storyline about needing assistance to transfer a large inheritance from a high-profile individual's family is highly unlikely and common in scam emails.\n\n2. **Personal Information Requests**: The email asks for sensitive personal information, which is a red flag. Legitimate requests for partnerships or legal matters would not normally come via email from unknown parties and certainly wouldn't ask for such personal details.\n\n3. **Financial Motive**: The promise of a large financial reward (20% of $22 million) is designed to entice you. This is typical of scams where the victim is eventually asked to pay \"administrative\" fees or similar charges upfront.\n\n4. **Urgency and Secrecy**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency and require confidentiality to prevent you from seeking advice or doing research.\n\n5. **Fictitious Identities**: The email claims connections to well-known figures like Kofi Annan to gain credibility, but these are false.\n\nTo handle this email:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Do not engage with the sender or provide any personal information.\n- **Mark as Spam**: Use your email provider's feature to mark the email as spam or phishing.\n- **Delete the Email**: Remove it from your inbox and trash folder to avoid accidentally interacting with it.\n- **Report the Scam**: You can report the email to relevant authorities or organizations that handle internet fraud in your country.\n\nAlways be cautious with unsolicited emails asking for personal or financial information, especially those promising large sums of money."

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a time-sensitive matter requiring international collaboration.  \n\nIn June 1998, following the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha, authorities intercepted six diplomatic trunks containing foreign currencies totaling $197,570,000 during an attempted departure by his associates. As part of the investigative team, I officially declared five trunks to the Federal Government. The sixth trunk, containing $30,000,000, was retained under my supervision to prevent its misuse during the heightened scrutiny of Abacha‚Äôs offshore assets, widely reported by outlets such as The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and the BBC.  \n\nTo secure these funds, the trunk was deposited with SecureLogistics Nigeria Ltd., a licensed security firm, under the classification ‚ÄúPrecious Stones & Jewelry‚Äù to avoid suspicion. With the situation now stabilized, my two trusted colleagues and I seek to relocate this trunk abroad via diplomatic channels, as Nigerian civil service regulations prohibit officials from holding foreign accounts or investments.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will be registered as the consignment‚Äôs beneficiary, with SecureLogistics coordinating its transfer to their affiliate office in [Your Country]. Documentation will reflect your purchase of ‚Äúgemstones‚Äù during a fictitious visit to Nigeria.  \n2. Upon arrival, we will meet to retrieve the trunk. You will open a local account to temporarily hold the funds, after which gradual remittance to your primary accounts can be arranged.  \n3.

They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. I am a Dubai-based oil trader currently undergoing treatment for late-stage pancreatic cancer. My physicians estimate I have only weeks remaining.  \n\nIn light of my prognosis, I am prioritizing the allocation of a dormant asset: $35 million USD held in a secure private vault with Al-Mansoori Security Services (Dubai branch) since 2003. This fund was earmarked for disaster relief but remained untouched due to my previous focus on business.  \n\nRecent events have compelled me to act. Earlier this year, I entrusted family members to disburse a separate charitable sum through a Saudi Arabian bank account. Regrettably, they diverted the funds for personal use. This breach of trust necessitates external assistance to ensure the $35 million reaches its intended recipients: verified NGOs supporting tsunami recovery efforts in Southeast Asia and hurricane relief programs in the Gulf Coast (USA).  \n\nYour Role:  \n1. Authorize you as my fiduciary agent to retrieve the deposit from Al-Mansoori Security Services.  \n2. Oversee distribution to pre-vetted organizations (documentation available upon engagement).  \n3. Retain 10% ($3.5M) for administrative costs and time compensation.  \n\nRequired for Legal Processing:  \n- Full name, residential address, and occupation  \n- Direct contact number (e.g., +971-4-910-4953 format)  \n- Government-issued ID copy (scanned) for notarized authorization  \n\nI have instructed my legal advisor, Mr. Faisal Al-Haddad (f.alhaddad@almansoorilegal.ae | Office: +971-4-223-8801), to expedite paperwork upon your confirmation.  \n\nWhile I understand the unusual nature of this request, time constraints prevent conventional vetting. I implore you to respond within 72 hours to avoid probate complications.  \n\nMay Allah grant us both clarity in this endeavor.  \n\nSincerely,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nManaging Director | Yusuf Petrochemicals Group  \nBusiness Bay, Dubai, UAE  \nOffice: +971-4-555-1729  \nNote: All communications are monitored by my medical team due to my condition.",

        "one-round response": "This email appears to be a classic example of a phishing scam or advance-fee fraud, commonly known as a \"Nigerian Prince\" scam. It uses a compelling narrative and urgency to entice recipients to provide personal information or potentially send money under false pretenses. Here are some reasons why this email should be treated with caution:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Message**: Legitimate business proposals or charitable requests are rarely sent out as unsolicited emails to random individuals.\n\n2. **Personal Information Request**: Scammers often ask for personal information such as your full name, address, phone number, and identification. Legitimate organizations will not request sensitive information in this manner.\n\n3. **Too Good to Be True**: The promise of a large sum of money for minimal effort is a common tactic used in scams. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n4. **Urgency and Time Constraints**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push recipients into making hasty decisions without proper vetting or verification.\n\n5. **Errors and Inconsistencies**: Look for errors in grammar or spelling, or inconsistencies in the story. These are typical in phishing emails, though this one appears fairly well-written.\n\n6. **Check Sources and Legitimacy**: Verify the legitimacy of the sender's email address and contact details independently, but do so using other sources. This often reveals discrepancies.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Do not provide any personal information or respond to the email.\n  \n- **Mark as Spam**: Use your email provider‚Äôs options to mark the email as spam or phishing.\n\n- **Delete the Email**: Safely delete the email from your inbox.\n\n- **Report the Email**: Consider reporting the phishing attempt to relevant authorities or your email provider to help combat future scams.\n\nAlways be vigilant with unsolicited emails, especially those requesting sensitive information or offers involving large sums of money."

It is circumstances that made to \nsend this to you.\n\nI will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a \nyear ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess.

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. I apologize for the abrupt nature of this request, but I believe your discretion and goodwill could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother‚Äôs estate.  \n\nMy mother, Ms. Helen Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of Kem Industries, a manufacturing firm based in Johannesburg. Tragically, her business partner, Mr. Philip Brown, was implicated in her death (ruled as poisoning by authorities) and subsequently arrested. Before her passing, my mother secured a $9.8 million deposit with Standard Continental Bank to procure machinery for a new subsidiary. The bank holds strict instructions to transfer these funds only to a designated overseas supplier account‚Äîa detail now complicated by her death.  \n\nDespite being her sole heir, my family has disowned me due to disputes over her estate. They have revoked my access to her properties and frozen my financial resources. During a review of her documents, I discovered this dormant account. The bank cannot release the funds without proof of a valid supplier account, and disclosing her death would risk forfeiting the deposit entirely under the bank‚Äôs compliance policies.  \n\nHere‚Äôs how you can assist:  \n1. Provide a foreign bank account (personal or corporate) to be listed as the ‚Äúsupplier‚Äù recipient.  \n2. Coordinate discreetly to transfer 85% of the funds to me (15% commission is yours) once released.  \n3. Advise on relocation options, as my safety here is compromised.  \n\nI have consulted a legal advisor to ensure this process complies with banking regulations, provided the transfer is framed as fulfilling my mother‚Äôs original intent. Confidentiality is paramount‚Äîthe bank must not learn of her passing until the transaction concludes.  \n\nIf willing to proceed, kindly reply with your contact number and a suitable time to discuss. You may reach me at +27 76 418 3291 or joy.kem@protonmail.com.  \n\nThank you for considering this urgent appeal.

After thorough verification of your credentials, I believe you are well-suited to assist in finalizing an outstanding contractual matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2022, my department oversaw a mining infrastructure project managed by a foreign contractor. Due to administrative adjustments during the project‚Äôs execution, an over-invoiced balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) remains unallocated. This surplus has received provisional approval for repatriation to a non-domestic account, pending submission of valid offshore banking details.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs civil servants, we are legally restricted from holding foreign accounts. We seek a reputable international partner to act as the beneficiary for this transfer. Upon confirmation of your participation, our legal team will file a ‚ÄúTransfer of Rights‚Äù application with the Ministry of Justice to designate your entity as the successor to the original contractor.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Your Share: 25% (USD 2,625,000) for facilitating the transfer.  \n- Our Share: 70% retained for departmental reallocation.  \n- Remaining 5%: Covers administrative fees, including notarization and banking charges.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant under South African Treasury Regulation 16.4.3 (Offshore Remittances for Contractual Obligations).

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch by the late Engr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  \n\nBackground of the Matter:  \nIn August 1996, Engr. Lee Seunghyo opened a 12-month fixed deposit account valued at USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars). Upon maturity in 1997, routine notifications were dispatched to his registered address but received no response. Subsequent investigations revealed that Engr. Lee tragically perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam (August 1997). Further inquiries confirmed he died intestate (without a will) and left no declared next of kin or beneficiaries in his bank records or NNPC employment documents.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed funds exceeding 10 years are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. However, as the account‚Äôs custodian, I have secured a Court Order of Mandamus (Case Ref: FHC/L/CP/342/2024) to identify a lawful beneficiary before the impending deadline of October 31, 2024.  \n\nProposal for Collaboration:  \nTo prevent these funds from reverting to government custody, I propose nominating you as the deceased‚Äôs next of kin. As a foreign national, you qualify to claim the deposit, as local regulations prohibit direct transfers to Nigerian accounts for dormant USD holdings.  \n\nRequired Steps:  \n1. Provide the following details to initiate legal documentation:  \n   - Full Name & Residential Address  \n   - Date of Birth & Occupation  \n   - Contact Telephone Number (for verification)  \n\n2. Our retained legal team, Adeoye & Associates Legal Practitioners, will draft a notarized affidavit and probate documents to establish your status as the beneficiary.  \n\n3. Funds will be transferred to your designated offshore account upon approval.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (facilitation and risk coverage)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (pre-deducted prior to disbursement)  \n\nConfidentiality & Assurance:  \nThis transaction is protected under attorney-client privilege. My position as Credit Manager ensures all processes comply with internal protocols. Strict discretion is required to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nAct Now:  \nKindly respond within 72 hours to secure your slot.

My name is Lydia Johnson, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. My late husband, Major Stephen Johnson, served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia during his administration. Following the president‚Äôs exile and the escalation of political unrest in Monrovia, my family has faced severe hardship.  \n\nTragically, my husband was killed by armed rebels during a targeted attack six months ago. Fearing for our safety, I fled Monrovia with my son David (23) and four daughters. With the aid of a security contact, we crossed the border into Dakar, Senegal, where we currently reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly deposited US$7 million with a private financial institution here in Dakar (verified as Banque de S√©curit√© Financi√®re - Dakar). Due to my deteriorating health (I suffer from advanced diabetes and hypertension) and the instability in Senegal‚Äôs border regions, I urgently seek a trustworthy partner abroad to facilitate the transfer and safekeeping of these funds. This sum represents my family‚Äôs sole remaining asset, as our properties in Liberia were destroyed by rebel forces.  \n\nYour role would involve acting as a designated beneficiary to receive the funds into a secure account in your country. A legal representative here in Dakar will handle all documentation and logistics. For your assistance, you would retain 15% of the total amount, with the remainder allocated to my family‚Äôs resettlement and medical care.  \n\nDue to security concerns, I must emphasize the confidentiality of this request. You may contact me directly at lydia.johnson.assist@gmail.com or through my legal advisor, Mr. Amadou Diallo, at +221 77 854 3291 (Senegal).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this appeal and would gladly provide additional verification through secure channels. Your discretion is paramount, as my children‚Äôs safety depends on swift resolution.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nDakar, Senegal  \n\nNote: All identifiers, including bank names and contacts, are fabricated for training purposes and do not represent real entities or individuals.",

I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank.

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing under deeply personal and urgent circumstances. I apologize for reaching out unprompted, but I believe your expertise could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother‚Äôs estate.  \n\nBackground:  \nMy mother, Ms. Eliza Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of KemCo Industries, a venture she co-founded with a business partner, Mr. Philip Brown. Tragically, her death was ruled a poisoning, and Mr. Brown was arrested shortly afterward. Though he denied involvement, he coerced my uncles (my mother‚Äôs brothers) into signing agreements that excluded me from her company. I was later removed entirely for opposing their legal counsel, who I suspect colluded in her death.  \n\nRecently, while reviewing her financial records, I discovered a dormant account at First Continental Trust Bank (UK) containing $9,800,000. Per her deposit agreement, these funds were earmarked to purchase machinery for a new subsidiary. However, the bank cannot release the money without proof of a valid ‚Äúcustomer account‚Äù linked to the intended machinery supplier.  \n\nThe Situation:  \nMy relatives have disowned me, seized her property, and threatened my safety. I cannot approach the bank directly, as they believe my mother is still alive (I claimed she is hospitalized to maintain her authority). To access the funds, I urgently need:  \n\n1. A Corporate Bank Account: You would act as the overseas supplier, allowing the bank to transfer the $9.8 million into an account under your name or business.  \n2. Relocation Support: Assistance arranging safe passage from Lagos to your country once the transfer is complete.  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 15% of the total amount ($1,470,000) for your partnership.  \n\nWhy Trust Me?  \nI am my mother‚Äôs only child (born when she was 18), and my father abandoned us before my birth. At 20, I have no family, resources, or legal recourse here. Attached are redacted copies of the bank agreement and my mother‚Äôs death certificate for verification.  \n\nThis request is confidential. If you are willing to help, please reply to joy.kem.assist@gmail.com or call +44 77 5348 1921 by October 15th. I will provide full documentation and coordinate next steps promptly.  \n\nThank you for considering this appeal. Your discretion and compassion could save my life and honor my mother‚Äôs legacy.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMiss Joy Kem  \n(On behalf of the Kem Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: All documentation will be verified through a trusted third-party legal advisor to ensure mutual security.

My name is Mrs. Jewel Taylor, wife of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. As you may be aware, my husband has resided in Nigeria under political asylum since 2003, following the instability in Liberia. Recent developments by the United Nations and current Liberian authorities have necessitated his potential repatriation for judicial proceedings.  \n\nDue to heightened scrutiny, certain financial assets linked to my family have been restricted by the interim government. Among these is a trust holding $30,270,000.00 (thirty million two hundred and seventy thousand US dollars), originally designated for humanitarian projects. This account is now at risk of seizure, despite its legitimate origins.  \n\nGiven these circumstances, I seek your discretion to act as an intermediary to safeguard these funds. The process would involve transferring the amount temporarily to a secure offshore account under your name, after which my legal team will reclaim it through diplomatic channels. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total sum as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to international compliance standards, and my family‚Äôs legal advisors will oversee every step to ensure legality. Due to confidentiality concerns, I kindly request you reply directly to my private email: jeandcine@yahoo.co.uk, or contact me via secure line at +231 88 654 3219 (Monrovia).  \n\nTime is of the essence, as the government intends to finalize asset forfeiture within 10 business days.

I write to you under strict confidentiality to propose a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding an unclaimed account in our records.  \n\nIn 2000, Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska, perished alongside his family in the tragic Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash (January 31, 2000). Documentation confirming this event is publicly available via the [CNN Archives](http://edition.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.crash/). Mr. Thompson maintained a dormant account (No. 14-2558-5976) with a balance of USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  \n\nPer Burkina Faso banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after four years. Despite repeated efforts to locate next-of-kin, no claimants have surfaced. As a foreign national, Mr. Thompson‚Äôs account requires a non-Burkinab√© beneficiary to avoid forfeiture.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next-of-kin to facilitate the transfer.  \n2. I will furnish verified documentation to legitimize your claim.  \n3. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% (USD 3,750,000.00) to you.  \n   - 5% allocated for administrative fees (taxes, legal, and transfer costs).  \n   - 65% retained by myself to secure internal approvals.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with BOA‚Äôs internal protocols.

My name is Martin Chime, and I serve as a senior account manager at this branch. Your contact was discreetly recommended by a trusted intermediary within the Lagos Chamber of Commerce due to your international residency status, which aligns with the requirements of this matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national, Mr. Kemal Aydin (a Turkish contractor residing in Lagos), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million. Mr. Aydin tragically passed away in a road accident later that year, and no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds in the intervening four years. Under Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the government if unclaimed.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs a bank employee, I am ethically obligated to resolve such cases transparently. However, given the lack of claimants, my team (including two senior colleagues) has identified a lawful pathway to transfer these funds to a qualified beneficiary. We propose to formally designate you as Mr. Aydin‚Äôs distant relative and executor of his estate. Your role would involve providing basic documentation (e.g., passport, proof of address) to validate this claim. All internal bank approvals and probate processes have been prearranged to ensure swift execution.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Timeline: 10 business days to finalize documentation and release funds.  \n- Compensation: 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million) for your participation.  \n- Confidentiality: Communication will occur exclusively via secure channels until completion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, confirm your interest by replying to this email or contacting me directly at +234 809 755 4321 (WhatsApp/SMS) or mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com. Upon your confirmation, I will forward a detailed procedural guide, including templates for required affidavits and notarized forms. Our legal team will oversee all filings to ensure compliance with Nigerian probate law.  \n\nThis opportunity is time-sensitive, as regulatory audits of dormant accounts are scheduled in the coming weeks. Rest assured, the process is entirely legal and structured to avoid future disputes.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nBest regards,  \nMartin Chime  \nSenior Account Manager  \nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA), Ilupeju Branch  \nLagos, Nigeria  \nTel: +234 809 755 4321 | Email: mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your assistance in securing a financial legacy left by my late husband.  \n\nPrior to his passing, General Abacha established a USD 25 million deposit with a licensed security firm in Accra, Ghana, designated solely for my family‚Äôs welfare. Due to ongoing investigations by the Nigerian government and international entities‚Äîspearheaded by Swiss lawyer Enrico Monfrini‚Äîinto my late husband‚Äôs estate, we have been unable to access these funds directly. As reported by The Guardian on March 15, 2000, significant assets linked to our family have been frozen or seized, leaving this deposit as our last recourse.  \n\nOur family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has safeguarded my husband‚Äôs final will, which authorizes the release of these funds to a designated foreign trustee. Due to travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of our associates, we require a discreet third party to act as the beneficiary of record. Your role would involve facilitating the transfer of the funds to a secure offshore account under your name, after which the entirety of the sum would be redirected to our family‚Äôs custody.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- The deposit is held at Ghana Trust Securities Ltd., with valid Certificates of Deposit and a Notarized Power of Attorney prepared for your review.  \n- Barrister Musa will meet you in Accra to finalize documentation and accompany you to the depository.  \n- For security, all correspondence must occur via his secure email: tony.musalaw@abachalawfirm.com.ng or phone: +233 55 712 3098 (Ghana office).  \n\nYour Commitment:  \n1. Reply promptly with your full contact details (phone/fax) to enable direct coordination.  \n2. Maintain absolute confidentiality to avoid jeopardizing the process.  \n3. Upon successful transfer, you will receive USD 1.2 million (5% of the total) as compensation.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the depository requires proof of beneficiary status within 21 days to avoid forfeiture. I emphasize that this transaction is lawful and has been structured by our legal team, including consultation with the late Johnnie Cochran, to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nYour discretion and goodwill are paramount. Kindly confirm your willingness to assist by replying to Barrister Musa directly.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Maryam Abacha  \nOn behalf of the Abacha Family Estate  \n\n---  \nNote: This email simulates a real-world scam for training purposes.

Official banks usually do not communicate such matters through unverified emails, nor do they propose such arrangements to strangers.\n\n6. **Contact and Verification**: The contact information and references to laws and regulations can be fabricated.

I am writing to you under extraordinary circumstances and apologize for the sudden nature of this request.  \n\nMy late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the Managing Director of Royal Diamond Corporation in Kigali. Tragically, he and my mother were killed during the civil unrest in 2018, and our family‚Äôs assets were seized or destroyed. Before his passing, he secured a deposit certificate valued at $4.2 million USD under my name at the Bank of Kigali (Ref: BK-DC-4892).  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to the funds. However, due to my current refugee status (UNHCR Case ID: RW-1129-45M), Rwandan monetary policy prohibits me from directly accessing the account. The Central Bank of Rwanda requires a foreign national to act as a trustee to finalize the transfer.  \n\nI have been advised by my legal representative, Mr. Jean-Claude Niyomugabo (Bar License: RBA-6631), to identify a trustworthy individual abroad to facilitate this process. Your contact was recommended through a private directory, and I humbly ask if you would consider assisting me.  \n\nUpon your agreement:  \n1.

The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria.

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring urgent cooperation.  \n\nFollowing the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha on June 8, 1998, a routine customs inspection uncovered six diplomatic trunks aboard a chartered flight bound for Saudi Arabia. These trunks contained foreign currency totaling $197,570,000.00 USD. Per protocol, five trunks were declared to the government, while one containing $30,000,000.00 USD was discreetly secured to avoid public scrutiny during ongoing investigations into misappropriated state funds.  \n\nAs reported by The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and The London Times (July 12, 1998), international audits revealed billions linked to Abacha‚Äôs associates. To mitigate risks, the remaining trunk was deposited with a licensed security firm under the classification ‚ÄúPrecious Stones & Jewelry‚Äù to obscure its contents. With recent legal clarity, my two trusted colleagues and I now seek to transfer this asset abroad via diplomatic channels, a process requiring third-party collaboration.  \n\nDue to Nigerian Civil Service regulations prohibiting foreign account ownership, we require your assistance to receive and safeguard these funds internationally.

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \nreceive this letter.

I am contacting you with a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your immediate attention and utmost discretion.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Henry Whitaker, tragically passed away in a plane crash alongside his immediate family. Following standard protocol, our institution has held his dormant account containing USD $10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) while awaiting claims from a verified next of kin. Regrettably, all documented relatives perished in the same incident, and no legitimate claimant has come forward in over two decades.  \n\nPer ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after a five-year period. However, due to Mr. Whitaker‚Äôs status as a foreign national, Burkina Faso law prohibits local citizens from acting as next of kin for international accounts. To resolve this matter, I propose a confidential partnership wherein you would be formally recognized as the beneficiary to facilitate the fund‚Äôs release.  \n\nTerms of Collaboration:  \n1. Your Role: Provide a non-Burkinabe bank account to receive the funds.  \n2. Distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (as the designated beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated for administrative and legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by my office for fiduciary management.  \n3. Process:  \n   - Submit a brief application to ADB, attesting to your relation to the deceased (template attached).  \n   - Provide your full banking details (account name, number, SWIFT/BIC) and contact information.  \n\nAll documentation will be processed under strict confidentiality. Upon approval, I will personally oversee the transfer and arrange to meet in your country for final disbursement.  \n\nRequired Details for Application:  \n- Full Name & Nationality  \n- Bank Name, Account Number, and SWIFT/BIC Code  \n- Contact Telephone/Fax Number  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: ibrahim.mussa@adb-bf.org  \n- Office Line: +226 25 44 58 90 (Mon‚ÄìFri, 8:00 AM‚Äì4:00 PM GMT)  \n\nThis proposal is time-bound, as the ADB treasury audit cycle concludes on [Date: 30 days from current date]. Immediate action is advised to secure the funds before reclassification.  \n\nI assure you this transaction adheres to all legal protocols and guarantees mutual benefit. Your prompt response is appreciated.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nIbrahim Mussa  \nBill and Exchange Manager  \nAfrican Development Bank (ADB), Ouagadougou  \n\n---  \nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest.

I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of handling sensitive international transactions.  \n\nFollowing my husband‚Äôs demise, the current administration has subjected me to relentless scrutiny and harassment, including freezing family assets and restricting my movements. While media reports claim the recovery of $700 million linked to my late husband‚Äôs accounts abroad, these allegations are exaggerated and politically motivated. To secure my future, I discreetly transferred $35 million USD to a private security firm in Europe (identity disclosed upon your agreement). Due to my house arrest, I cannot access these funds directly.  \n\nI seek your assistance to receive this amount into a secure bank account under your name. For your support, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million USD), with the remainder reserved for my relocation and legal fees. My family attorney, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu, will oversee all documentation and liaise with you confidentially. Rest assured, this transaction carries no legal risk, as I retain full authority over the funds.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $35,000,000.00 USD (held in escrow).  \n- Your Compensation: 20% ($7,000,000.00 USD).  \n- Confidentiality: Critical to avoid interception by Nigerian authorities.  \n- Next Steps: Reply to presidentwife@ngindiatimes.com and CC prof.adams@usa-mail.com to confirm your interest.  \n\nGiven surveillance measures, I cannot risk visiting embassies or using monitored communication channels.

I am reaching out to you in strict confidence to propose a legitimate collaboration that could yield significant mutual benefit.  \n\nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified an escrow account holding $12.5 million (USD). This account, opened in 1999, has remained inactive since 2000. Upon further investigation, I confirmed it belongs to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and Alaska resident who tragically perished with his family in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records corroborate this event (see [CNN Archives](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list) and [Thompson‚Äôs biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html)).  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account‚Äôs documentation, I confirmed no beneficiaries or next-of-kin claims exist. Per Ghanaian banking regulations, dormant accounts without claimants after 10 years may be transferred to the state. However, as Branch Manager, I retain discretionary authority to expedite the release of funds to a verified foreign next-of-kin.  \n\nProposed Collaboration:  \n1.

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as an independent auditing consultant for a prominent financial institution in Nigeria. I am writing to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate requiring urgent intervention.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit in 2022, I discovered an inactive account held by a deceased client, Mr. Alain Mercier, a French industrialist and long-term customer of the bank. Mr. Mercier tragically perished in the Concorde Flight AF4590 crash on July 25, 2000, alongside all passengers. The account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains dormant as no legal will or designated beneficiary was identified.  \n\nExtensive efforts to locate Mr. Mercier‚Äôs next of kin‚Äîincluding coordination with French authorities and private investigators‚Äîhave been unsuccessful. Per Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to federal reserves after 25 years. In this case, the bank‚Äôs board has expedited proceedings to reclassify the funds by Q1 2024, with intentions to allocate them to government-administered trust funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the forfeiture of these funds, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal beneficiary via probate documentation, prepared by my associate attorney, Mr. Kwame Asante (Esq.).  \n2. The bank will authorize an initial transfer of $10,000,000.00 (USD) to your nominated account.  \n3. Upon successful completion, the remaining balance will follow within 7‚Äì9 business days.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- 65% of the total sum allocated to my team.  \n- 20% retained by you as beneficiary.  \n- 10% donated to humanitarian initiatives (mutually agreed upon).  \n- 5% reserved for administrative expenses (legal fees, bank charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- A valid government-issued ID (scanned copy).  \n- Your private contact number and secure email for documentation review.  \n- Confirmation of a non-resident bank account (non-Nigerian) for fund remittance.  \n\nAll processes adhere to legal protocols, including a validated court order (Ref: FHC/ABJ/CS/891/2023) and notarized affidavits. Strict confidentiality is assured.  \n\nPlease reply urgently to secure this opportunity.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nConsulting Auditor  \nBNP Legal & Financial Consulting Group  \nTel: +234 802 555 0193 | Email: jcabutti.consulting@bnplgrp.com  \n\nThis communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

It contains several red flags typical of a scam known as a \"419 scam\" or \"advance-fee fraud.\" Here are some reasons why this email is suspicious:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Offer**: Legitimate financial institutions do not contact random individuals with offers to claim large sums of money.\n\n2. **High-Pressure Tactics**: The email creates a sense of urgency and confidentiality to pressure you into responding quickly without thoroughly thinking it through.\n\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: The sender asks for sensitive personal information, such as a scanned copy of your ID and bank account details, which can be used for identity theft or other fraudulent activities.\n\n4. **Too Good to Be True**: The offer of a large sum of money for little to no effort on your part is a classic sign of a scam.\n\n5. **Suspicious Details**: The backstory involving an unclaimed estate and the detailed breakup of fund allocation resembles common narratives used in scams.\n\n6. **Questionable Legitimacy**: The use of a generic email domain and lack of verifiable contact information (e.g., website or employee authenticity of \"BNP Legal & Financial Consulting Group\") raise doubts about the legitimacy of the sender.\n\nGiven these concerns:\n\n- **Do Not Respond**: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information.\n  \n- **Mark as Spam/Phishing**: Use your email provider‚Äôs tools to mark the email as spam or phishing.\n  \n- **Delete the Email**: After marking it as spam or phishing, delete the email from your inbox.\n\n- **Stay Informed**: Familiarize yourself with common scam tactics to better recognize them in the future.\n\nIf you have any uncertainties or concerns about the safety of your personal information or accounts, consider contacting relevant authorities or a cybersecurity professional."

My name is Victoria Karegaye, and I am writing to seek your assistance with a sensitive financial matter. I apologize for reaching out unexpectedly, but circumstances have left me with limited options.  \n\nI am a 22-year-old Rwandan national, and my late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the managing director of Royal Diamond Company in Kigali. Tragically, both my parents lost their lives during the civil unrest in Rwanda several years ago. Before his passing, my father secured a deposit certificate at a reputable international bank in my name, valued at $2.75 million USD.  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to these funds. However, due to my current refugee status and strict international banking regulations (specifically AML/KYC policies for displaced persons), I am prohibited from opening an account to access the deposit. The bank has advised me to appoint a trusted representative abroad to facilitate the transfer on my behalf.  \n\nThis is where I humbly ask for your help. If you are willing to act as my intermediary, I will provide all necessary legal documents, including the deposit certificate, death certificates, and court affidavits. In return, you would retain 20% of the total amount as compensation for your assistance.  \n\nPlease note:  \n- The bank has confirmed this transaction complies with anti-money laundering laws, provided proper documentation is submitted.  \n- All communication will remain confidential.  \n- I can be reached at victoria.karegaye@yahoo.com or +250 78 345 6721 (WhatsApp) to discuss next steps.  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is legitimate.

You can also report it to local authorities or relevant cybercrime organizations.\n4. **Delete the Email**: Once reported, delete the email to avoid any future temptation to respond.\n5. **Stay Informed**: Familiarize yourself with common signs of scams and be skeptical of similar future communications.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to exercise caution and protect yourself from potential scams by remaining vigilant and following these precautionary measures."

Responding could result in more scam attempts or even identity theft.\n\n2. **Do Not Provide Personal Information**: Never give out personal, financial, or sensitive information to such unsolicited requests.\n\n3. **Mark as Spam/Report**: Mark the email as spam in your email client to help filter future scam attempts.

I am the widow of Daniel Somba, who served as a diplomatic attach√© at the Indian Embassy in Ivory Coast until his untimely passing in 2001 after a brief illness. We were married for eleven years but were not blessed with children.  \n\nFollowing my husband‚Äôs death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my faith. Before his passing, Daniel entrusted $5.5 million USD to a private security depository here in Abidjan to secure our family‚Äôs future. Regrettably, my health has deteriorated in recent years. I have been diagnosed with terminal cancer and have also suffered multiple strokes, leaving me unable to manage this matter personally.  \n\nWith no immediate family to inherit these funds, I feel compelled by scripture (‚ÄúBlessed is the hand that gives‚Äù) to direct this money toward charitable causes aligned with my faith.

I am contacting you regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring immediate attention.  \n\nDuring a routine audit, my team discovered an unclaimed account holding $15,000,000 USD belonging to a foreign client who, along with his family, tragically perished in a plane crash in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, we have confirmed no surviving relatives exist to claim these funds. Per our banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the state treasury after five years (December 2024). To avoid this outcome, I propose a lawful collaboration to secure the funds.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Legal Requirement: As the deceased was a foreign national, a non-Burkinab√© individual must act as the designated beneficiary.  \n- Distribution:  \n  - 30% to you (as beneficiary).  \n  - 10% to cover administrative and legal fees.  \n  - 60% retained by my team for charitable initiatives in Burkina Faso.  \n- Process: You will submit a notarized affidavit confirming your status as a distant relative. My team will handle all documentation and liaise with the Foreign Remittance Department.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and provide:  \n   - Full name, contact number, and a secure email.  \n   - Bank account details (IBAN/SWIFT) for the transfer.  \n2. I will forward the affidavit template and procedural guidelines via encrypted email.  \n\nConfidentiality is paramount, as disclosure would compromise both your eligibility and my position. This transaction adheres to all international banking protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy.  \n\nYou may reach me at +226 75 43 21 09 or jkabure.audit@bco-bfa.bf.

Scammers often use generic email addresses or set up fake websites to appear legitimate.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle this email is to:\n\n- **Do Not Respond:** Do not reply to the email, provide any personal information, or engage with the sender.\n\n- **Do Not Click on Links:** Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from the email.\n\n- **Report the Scam:** You can report it to relevant authorities.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch.  \n\nAccount Details:  \n- Account Holder: Engr.

Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), opened this account in 1997. Regrettably, he perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam on August 6, 1997. Following standard protocols, our bank issued notifications to his registered address upon the deposit‚Äôs maturity. After receiving no response, we liaised with the NNPC, confirming his demise and the absence of a legally declared next of kin or will.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 10-year dormancy period are subject to escheatment to the Federal Government. This account is now at risk of forfeiture, as no beneficiaries have come forward in 26 years.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the funds from being absorbed into government holdings, I propose a lawful collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Engr. Lee‚Äôs designated beneficiary via probate documents.  \n2. Two licensed attorneys will draft and notarize the requisite affidavits and a retroactive will.  \n3. Funds will be transferred to a non-Nigerian account (mandated for USD repatriation).  \n\nRequired Information:  \nTo initiate documentation, kindly provide:  \n1.

A provisional Order of Mandamus has been secured to fast-track beneficiary claims, but we must act before the Q3 2024 regulatory audit.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nReply to this email to confirm your interest. I will then forward attorney contact details and a secure portal link to submit your information. All communications remain confidential under Section 12(d) of the Nigerian Banking Secrecy Act.  \n\nShould you decline, kindly notify me promptly so I may pursue alternate candidates.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDonald Ofu Obidima  \nSenior Credit Control Manager  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria  \nPhone: +234 809 755 4301  \nEmail: donald.obidima@uniontrustbank-ng.com  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) | RC 41981  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

Sharing such details can lead to identity theft.\n\n4. **Too Good to Be True**: The proposal of a significant payment for minimal effort on your part is highly suspicious.\n\n5. **Legal and Financial Sophistication**: Scammers often include complex legal and financial terms to create a facade of legitimacy.\n\n6. **Unprofessional Format and Errors**: Scam emails sometimes contain errors in language or formatting, though this one might be more polished.\n\n### How to Handle It:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Do not reply to the email or provide any personal information.\n\n2. **Mark as Spam**: Move the email to your spam or junk folder to help your email provider filter similar emails in the future.\n\n3. **Delete the Email**: After marking it as spam, delete the email from your inbox.\n\n4. **Report It**: You can report the email to your email service provider or local authorities if they have a mechanism for reporting phishing attempts.\n\n5. **Stay Informed**: Educate yourself further on how to recognize phishing emails and scams to avoid falling victim to them in the future.\n\nIf you're ever uncertain about the legitimacy of an email, it's always best to err on the side of caution and consult with a professional or conduct an online search for similar scams or warnings."

My name is Mrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye, widow of the late Mr. Issac Nuhan Vaye, who served as Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia until his untimely death in 2003. I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances, seeking your discretion and assistance.  \n\nAs you may be aware from international media coverage (e.g., BBC, CNN), Liberia endured significant political instability during the presidency of Charles Taylor. My husband was wrongfully accused of conspiring against Taylor‚Äôs regime and executed without trial. Before his death, he discreetly secured $21.5 million USD through diplomatic channels, originally intended for agricultural infrastructure projects. These funds remain held by a private security logistics firm in Europe, awaiting legitimate transfer to a trustworthy partner.  \n\nDue to my restricted mobility (I am confined to our family estate under government surveillance) and monitored communications, I cannot act directly. My legal representative, Barrister James Broderick (based in London, UK), will facilitate the process. He will furnish you with documentation to verify this matter, including proof of deposit and my husband‚Äôs political records.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. Barrister Broderick will coordinate with the security firm to transfer the funds to a designated account under your name.  \n2. For your assistance, 20% ($4.3 million USD) will be allocated to you, with the remainder reserved for relocating my family and reinvesting in Liberia‚Äôs agricultural sector.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nPlease contact Barrister Broderick directly via the details below to initiate proceedings. He will require your:  \n- Full name  \n- Residential/company address  \n- Private telephone and fax numbers (for secure communication)  \n\nContact Information:  \nName: Barrister James Broderick, Esq.  \nTel: +44 7040 120730  \nFax: +44 870 1348903  \nEmail: brr.jmsbroderick@kaixo.com | james.broderick@yahoo.com.hk  \n\nThis transaction is legally structured to comply with international financial regulations. However, confidentiality is critical given Liberia‚Äôs fragile political climate. I implore you to treat this matter with urgency and discretion.  \n\nShould you require independent verification, I encourage you to reference historical reports on my husband‚Äôs case via reputable outlets such as The Guardian or Reuters (search terms: ‚ÄúIsaac Nuhan Vaye,‚Äù ‚ÄúLiberia 2003 coup allegations‚Äù).  \n\nI respectfully request your prompt response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nMrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye  \nMonrovia, Liberia",

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer.

This communication pertains to an urgent financial matter requiring your immediate attention.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Gerald H. Bracken (deceased), held an account with a balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Tragically, Mr. Bracken and his immediate family perished in a plane crash in November of that year. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, no legal claimants have come forward. Per ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are designated for transfer to the national treasury after a 5-year dormancy period. However, due to Mr. Bracken‚Äôs foreign nationality, Burkinab√© law prohibits local citizens from acting as claimants, necessitating international collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next of kin to facilitate the transfer of funds into a secure offshore account under your name.  \n2. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% to you (as the foreign partner).  \n   - 60% retained by myself (for administrative oversight).  \n   - 10% allocated for transaction-related expenses (legal fees, banking charges).  \n\nRequired Action:  \n- Provide your full banking details (bank name, account number, SWIFT/BIC code).  \n- Confirm a direct contact number and email for documentation.  \n\nUpon receipt of your details, I will forward a notarized affidavit of kinship and transfer authorization forms via encrypted email. Rest assured, this process adheres strictly to ADB protocols, and all documentation will be validated by our legal team to ensure compliance.  \n\nGiven the sensitive nature of this transaction, I urge discretion and prompt action to prevent forfeiture of these funds.

My name is Mrs. Comfort Somba, a widow residing in Chennai, India. My late husband, Mr. Daniel Somba, served as a senior diplomat at the Indian Embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for nine years until his untimely passing in 2001 due to complications from pneumonia. We were married for 11 years but had no children.  \n\nFollowing Daniel‚Äôs death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my Christian faith. During his tenure abroad, my husband prudently secured a savings deposit of $5.5 million USD (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with Abidjan Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed private security vaulting firm in Ivory Coast.  \n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer and have suffered recurring complications from a stroke, leaving me physically weakened. Given my prognosis, I seek a compassionate, God-fearing individual or organization to steward these funds in alignment with biblical principles. Per my late husband‚Äôs wishes, the funds must be used to:  \n1. Support orphanages and widows in underserved communities.  \n2. Maintain places of worship and fund evangelistic missions.  \n3. Distribute Bibles and educational resources to impoverished regions.  \n\nAll legal documentation, including a notarized Letter of Authority and my husband‚Äôs deposit certificates, has been prearranged with Abidjan Secure Holdings. Upon your confirmation, their transfer department will validate your identity and initiate the release process. I have attached a reference case number (ASHL-1149/CS) for expedited handling.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact Mr. Amara Diallo, Senior Client Relations Officer, directly via:  \n- Email: client.services@abidjansecureholdings.ci  \n- Telephone: +225 07 85 23 41 09 (WhatsApp available)  \n\nPlease provide your full name, contact details, and a brief explanation of how you intend to fulfill this mission.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary.

My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of Kumasi Commercial Bank in Ghana. I am writing to you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive financial matter that requires your cooperation.  \n\n### Background of the Proposal  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts at our branch, I discovered an escrow account holding USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This account has remained inactive for nearly five years and is registered under the name of Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska.  \n\nRegrettably, Mr. Thompson and his family perished in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records confirm this tragedy, which you may verify through reputable sources such as:  \n- [CNN Archives: Alaska Airlines Crash Report](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska-airlines-list)  \n- [Morris Thompson‚Äôs Biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mthompson)  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account, I confirmed that no beneficiaries or next-of-kin were ever designated. Under Ghanaian banking regulations, unclaimed assets of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the state.  \n\n### Request for Collaboration  \nTo lawfully transfer these funds, I require a foreign partner to act as the legal next-of-kin to Mr. Thompson. As Branch Manager, I am positioned to authorize the release of the funds once credible documentation is submitted. Your role would involve:  \n1. Providing a valid international passport for identity verification.  \n2. Signing affidavits (prepared by my legal team) to establish your claim.  \n3. Receiving the funds into your designated account, after which we would share the proceeds.  \n\n### Proposed Terms  \n- 60% of the total amount to you (USD 7,500,000.00).  \n- 40% retained by me to cover administrative and legal expenses.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with my bank‚Äôs internal protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid external interference.  \n\n### Next Steps  \nIf agreeable, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Office Hours: 8:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM GMT)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n\nI urge discretion and prompt action to secure this opportunity.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMr. Godwin Akwesi  \nBranch Manager  \nKumasi Commercial Bank  \nAddress: PMB 245, Adum, Kumasi, Ghana  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent farmer and opposition leader within Zimbabwe‚Äôs Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, seeking your partnership to secure a family legacy.  \n\nPrior to his assassination by agents of the current regime, my father discreetly safeguarded USD $10,000,000 in the form of gemstones within a sealed metal trunk. This asset was intended to fund agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini but could not be utilized due to the government‚Äôs unlawful seizure of our estates and bank accounts. As the sole surviving heir, I am now tasked with relocating these funds abroad to reinvest them safely.  \n\nDue to my status as a political refugee in South Africa, local financial regulations restrict my ability to claim or manage such assets directly. I require a trusted partner in your country to act as the legal custodian of the trunk until I can establish residency. In return for your assistance, I am prepared to offer 15% of the total value ($1,500,000) as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will follow international legal protocols through a licensed security firm in Johannesburg. Strict confidentiality is imperative, as exposure could jeopardize both our safety and the success of this endeavor.  \n\nIf you are willing to assist, kindly confirm at your earliest convenience.

My name is Christina Holden, widow of Dr. Donald Holden, a Canadian geologist who worked with Shell Oil in Calgary until his passing in 2019 after a sudden cardiac event. During our 11-year marriage, we remained childless but committed to our faith as active members of Trinity Baptist Church in Vancouver.  \n\nFollowing Donald‚Äôs death, I relocated to Ottawa to manage his estate, which includes a $10.5 million trust fund held with Reserve Finance & Trust (Toronto branch), established through his lifetime savings. Recently, I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic cancer at St. Michael‚Äôs Hospital. My prognosis is limited, compounded by a mild stroke last month that has left me with limited mobility.  \n\nGiven my circumstances, I seek to transfer this fund to a reputable religious organization to fulfill our shared commitment to supporting orphanages, medical care for the disabled, and widows in underserved communities. My husband‚Äôs family, while kind, does not share our faith, and I cannot risk the funds being diverted from their intended purpose.  \n\nTo proceed, I require your official church documentation (registration details, mission statement, and recent charitable project summaries) to forward to my estate lawyer, Mr. James Miller (james.miller@holdenlegal.ca | +1-613-555-0198), who will draft the transfer paperwork. Strict confidentiality is essential to avoid external interference.  \n\nUpon verification, the funds will be released to your church‚Äôs designated account within 7‚Äì10 business days.

My prognosis, as confirmed by my medical team at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, leaves me with limited time. While I have allocated most of my assets to family, recent events have compelled me to seek an external partner to ensure a portion of my wealth reaches those truly in need.  \n\nSpecifically, I seek your help in disbursing $35 million USD held in a secured vault at Al-Madina Trust Vault Services (Dubai) since 2003. These funds were earmarked for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina.

Disbursement: 90% ($31.5M) will be distributed to vetted NGOs, including CARE International and the Red Crescent Society.  \n3.

If it doesn‚Äôt match the official domain of GTE Federal Credit Union, it could be fraudulent.\n\n2. **Look for Signs of Phishing:**\n   - Check for spelling and grammatical errors, though some phishing emails can be well-written.\n   - Be wary of urgent appeals and promises of rewards, especially if they seem too good to be true.\n\n3. **Use Official Channels:**\n   - Instead of clicking any links in the email, independently visit GTE Federal Credit Union‚Äôs official website by typing the URL in your browser or contacting them directly through verified contact information.\n   - Call their Member Services team using the number from the official website (1-800-955-4821) to confirm if the survey is legitimate.\n\n4. **Check the Link:**\n   - Hover over the link in the email (without clicking it) to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious or doesn‚Äôt match GTE Federal Credit Union's domain, do not click it.\n\n5. **Do Not Provide Sensitive Information:** Reputable financial institutions will not ask for sensitive personal information via email.\n\nIf, after these checks, you suspect the email is fraudulent, do not click on any links or provide any information. Report it to GTE Federal Credit Union through their official contact methods. If you have clicked the link or provided information, consider contacting GTE Federal Credit Union immediately for assistance and monitoring your accounts for any suspicious activity."

This is a common tactic used in phishing attempts.\n\n2. **Unfamiliar Sender**: Always verify the sender‚Äôs email address. Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar to a legitimate company's address but have unusual domains.\n\n3. **Links to External Websites**: The email contains a link that claims to be secure.

        "one-round response": "It's good to be cautious with emails like this, as they could be phishing attempts. Here's how you can assess its legitimacy and decide on your next steps:\n\n1. **Check the sender‚Äôs email address:** Legitimate emails from Costco usually come from a costco.com domain. The email address you mentioned (`rewards@costco-communications.com`) could be suspicious. Confirm with past legitimate emails from Costco if possible.\n\n2. **Look for generic greetings:** Many phishing emails do not personalize the greeting. If it doesn't address you by name, it could be a red flag.\n\n3. **Avoid clicking on links:** Instead of clicking any links in the email, manually type in the Costco website address (`www.costco.com`) into your browser to log in to your account and check for any available rewards or messages.\n\n4. **Check for spelling and grammatical errors:** Phishing emails often contain errors. Review the email carefully.\n\n5. **Verify through official channels:** Contact Costco's customer service directly using the number on their official website (not the one in the email) to verify if the reward is genuine.\n\n6. **Check for the presence of personal information:** Legitimate retailers typically include some sort of personal information that only they would know, like your membership number.\n\n7. **Hover over links:** If you hover over a link without clicking it, you might be able to see the actual URL it will direct you to. Verify that it‚Äôs a legitimate Costco URL.\n\nIn summary, exercise caution and verify through official channels before doing anything the email suggests."

        "one-round response": "It's always important to approach unsolicited survey requests with caution, especially when they appear to involve your financial institution. Here are some steps you can take to verify if this email is legitimate:\n\n1. **Check for Phishing Signs**: Look for signs that the email might be a phishing attempt, such as generic greetings, spelling errors, or suspicious-looking links. In this case, the email is addressed to you specifically, which is a positive sign, but you should still be cautious.\n\n2. **Verify the Sender**: Confirm that the email address of the sender is legitimate and matches previous official communications from GTE Federal Credit Union. Scammers often use email addresses that are very similar but not identical to the actual business.\n\n3. **Do Not Click Links Directly**: Avoid clicking any links in the email. Instead, manually type the official website of GTE Federal Credit Union into your browser and log in to your account through there to see if there are any messages or survey requests.\n\n4. **Contact the Institution Directly**: Use the contact information from the official website or your latest bank statement to reach out to GTE Federal Credit Union directly. Ask them if they sent the email and whether the survey is legitimate.\n\n5. **Sensitive Information Warning**: The email states that the survey will not ask for sensitive information. Never provide personal information such as your Social Security number, passwords, or account numbers in response to an email.\n\n6. **Unsubscribe with Caution**: If the email is legitimate and you wish to unsubscribe, do so through the official website of the institution or by contacting their support directly. Avoid clicking unsubscribe links directly from potentially suspicious emails.\n\nFollowing these steps will help you ensure your personal and financial security while determining if the survey is an authentic request from your credit union."

Here‚Äôs how you can approach this situation:\n\n1. **Do Not Click Links or Download Files:**\n   - The email includes a link to an external site purportedly containing evidence; such links can be dangerous and may lead to malware or phishing sites. Do not click on the link or download any files.\n\n2. **Verify the Sender:**\n   - The email address and domain (`legal@shafaqchyanne.media`) could be spoofed. Check whether this domain exists and if it‚Äôs legitimate. It's also unusual for legitimate companies to use unconventional email domains for legal matters.\n\n3. **Examine the Content:**\n   - Legitimate DMCA notices typically do not include threats of high statutory damages immediately. They usually include clear identification of the material, detailed ownership information, and do not ask you to download evidence from external links.\n\n4. **Consult with IT or Legal:**\n   - Forward the email to your institution‚Äôs IT department or legal team without clicking any links or downloading attachments. They can analyze it further and determine its authenticity.\n\n5. **Look for Inconsistencies:**\n   - There are syntax and procedural irregularities in the email, such as using a URL with instructions to alter it, that are common in phishing attempts.\n\nIn conclusion, treat this email with caution and involve relevant departments within your organization to ensure an appropriate response.

Here are some steps to help you determine how to handle it:\n\n1. **Verify the Sender:** Make sure the email is from a legitimate company. Check the sender's email address for anything suspicious or unusual. Look for slight misspellings or variations in the domain name.\n\n2. **Research the Company:** Look up Premier Auto Shield independently, rather than clicking on links in the email. Check for reviews, complaints, or any mention of scams associated with the company.\n\n3. **Consider Your Needs:** If you own a 2018‚Äì2022 vehicle and your factory warranty is indeed expiring, an extended protection plan may be useful. However, compare this offer with others in the market. Ensure that the terms and coverage meet your needs.\n\n4. **Contact the Company Directly:** Instead of using contact information from the email, find the company's contact details from their official website or other reliable sources. Call them directly to verify the offer.\n\n5. **Beware of Scams:** Be cautious with requests for personal or financial information. Legitimate companies won‚Äôt pressure you to act immediately or disclose sensitive information without proper assurance.\n\n6. **Check FTC Guidelines:** As the email mentions, it claims to be authorized under FTC guidelines. Check the FTC's website for information on how to spot and handle such communication.\n\n7. **Consult with Your Car Dealer or Manufacturer:** They might have similar or better offers for extended warranties, and their plans might be more reputable given their direct association with your vehicle.\n\nIf after these steps you determine the offer is legitimate and suits your needs, you might consider it. Otherwise, treat it with caution and prioritize options from trusted sources."
