Do not respond to the message or contact the supplier.\n2. Do not provide any personal or financial information.\n3. Verify the authenticity of the message by contacting the Chinese People's Armed Police Force directly, if possible.\n4. Report the message to your local authorities or a cybersecurity agency, if you suspect it's a phishing scam.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when receiving unsolicited messages, especially those that ask for personal or financial information."

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to seek your help with a time-sensitive matter involving a charitable trust.  \n\nMy late husband, Robert White, worked as an engineering contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for over 20 years until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution, which matured in 2007. The account holds approximately $7.5 million USD, including accrued interest. As his sole beneficiary, I was recently notified that the account has been classified as dormant. If no action is taken within the next 30 days, the funds will be forfeited to the bank under their unclaimed assets policy.  \n\nDue to my current circumstances‚ÄîI am undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital‚ÄîI am unable to travel or manage this process personally. My condition has left me unable to speak, and my physicians have advised that I have limited time remaining. I have already donated a significant portion of my estate (roughly $800,000 USD) to local churches and orphanages in Kinshasa. However, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to reputable international charities supporting widows, children‚Äôs education, and places of worship.  \n\nI am seeking a trustworthy individual to act as an authorized representative to reclaim these funds on my behalf and oversee their distribution to vetted organizations. Legal documentation from the bank (attached) confirms my status as the beneficiary, and a licensed attorney in Brussels, Mr. Daniel Lambert (+32 488 329 147 / d.lambert@brusselslegalassociates.be), stands ready to facilitate the transfer process.  \n\nWhile we have not met, I have prayed for guidance in identifying someone who shares my commitment to ethical stewardship. If you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact Mr. Lambert directly for further instructions. Due to privacy concerns (my late husband‚Äôs relatives are unaware of this arrangement), I ask that you treat this matter with discretion.  \n\nThank you for considering this request.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

To protect this remaining portion of the estate‚Äîformally willed to me and deposited with Ghana SafeGuard Trust Ltd.‚Äîour family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has advised its immediate transfer to a trusted foreign partner‚Äôs custody.  \n\nDue to ongoing travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of domestic financial activities, we require a discreet intermediary to claim the funds.

The email is from a supposed widow of a former Head of State, claiming to have a large sum of money that needs to be transferred.\n2. The email is asking for your assistance in transferring the funds, which is a common tactic used by scammers to gain your trust.\n3. The email claims that the transaction is time-sensitive and that any disclosure could jeopardize the process, which is a tactic used to create a sense of urgency and pressure you into responding quickly.\n4. The email asks you to provide your direct contact details, which could be used to scam you further or sell your information to other scammers.\n5. The email provides a fake contact email and phone number for a supposed lawyer, which is likely a fake identity created by the scammer.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle this email is to:\n\n1. Delete the email immediately.\n2. Do not respond to the email or provide any information.\n3. Report the email to your email provider's spam or abuse department.\n4. Be cautious of similar emails in the future, and never respond to unsolicited emails that ask for your assistance in transferring large sums of money.\n\nRemember, if an email seems too good (or bad) to be true, it probably is. Always be skeptical of unsolicited emails that ask for your assistance or promise large sums of money, and never provide your personal or financial information to unknown individuals or organizations."

        "generated text": "\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],  \n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Mrs. Lydia Johnson, aged 59, and I am writing to you under extraordinary circumstances. I am the widow of Major Stephen Johnson, who served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former Liberian President Charles Taylor during his administration. Following my husband‚Äôs tragic assassination by rebel forces last month, my family and I have been displaced to Dakar, Senegal, where we now reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nDue to the escalating conflict in Monrovia, my four daughters, my 23-year-old son David, and I were forced to flee our home with the assistance of government security personnel. Regrettably, all our properties and documentation were destroyed during the rebel incursion. Compounding this crisis, I suffer from chronic diabetes and hypertension, which has worsened under the stress of our displacement.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly secured US$7.2 million in a private trust account with the West African Trust & Finance Group here in Dakar. This fund was intended to safeguard our family‚Äôs future. However, due to legal restrictions tied to Liberia‚Äôs ongoing political crisis, I am unable to access or transfer these funds without a foreign collaborator. I require a trustworthy individual abroad to act as a designated beneficiary, enabling the release of these assets to a secure international account.  \n\nIn exchange for your assistance, I propose allocating 15% of the total sum to you, with the remainder reserved for resettling my family and covering urgent medical expenses. Strict confidentiality is paramount, as we remain under heightened scrutiny.  \n\nShould you be willing to assist, kindly respond to this email at your earliest convenience. For verification, I may be reached via phone at +221 77 234 5691 (Senegal) or through this secure ProtonMail address.  \n\nYour discretion and compassion in this matter would be a lifeline to my children and me.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nEmail: lydia.johnson.assist@protonmail.com  \nTel: +221 77 234 5691",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality regarding a deceased client and an unclaimed investment portfolio valued at six million United States Dollars (USD) under our institution‚Äôs management.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, the client (name withheld per privacy protocols) established a discretionary investment account with our private banking division. In mid-2004, the client instructed the liquidation of these funds for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Due to cross-border cash movement restrictions post-9/11, the funds were transferred to a licensed third-party security firm (name withheld for compliance reasons) specializing in high-net-worth asset custody.  \n\nThe client intended to retrieve the funds upon arrival in Europe later that year but passed away unexpectedly in Cannes, France, in November 2004. Despite exhaustive efforts by our internal investigations team and external affiliates, no next of kin was identified. Per private banking protocols, the account remains anonymous and inactive.  \n\nProposal:  \nRecent internal audits flagged this dormant account. As the sole custodian with knowledge of its existence, I propose a lawful resolution: I will facilitate your designation as the beneficiary via revised documentation, given your potential familial connection (identified through our audit trail). The security firm will release the funds to you upon my authorization.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Upon successful transfer, we will split the proceeds 60% to yourself and 40% to me for facilitating this discreetly.  \n- All interactions must remain confidential. Do not contact me via official channels (monitored per TQM policies). Use the dedicated contact details below.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply to dav.bryan@sifyprivate.co.uk or call +44 77 5342 1881 (secure line) within 72 hours. Disregard this email if unwilling to proceed.  \n\nCaution:  \nThis matter is time-sensitive and strictly confidential.

I am reaching out to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate under my purview, which I believe aligns with your professional expertise.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified a high-value deposit belonging to Mr. Pierre Laurent, a French industrialist and long-standing client of FCBN. Mr. Laurent tragically perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash on July 25, 2000. His account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains inactive as no legal beneficiary or next of kin was designated prior to his passing. Despite exhaustive efforts by the bank‚Äôs legal team to locate heirs‚Äîincluding liaising with French authorities and a private investigator‚Äîno legitimate claimants have surfaced.  \n\nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 20-year dormancy period are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. FCBN‚Äôs board has initiated proceedings to transfer these funds to the National Trust Fund for Humanitarian Relief by October 31, 2023, unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent this outcome, I propose nominating you as the legal beneficiary via a probate affidavit, retroactively designating you as Mr. Laurent‚Äôs business associate. My retained attorney, Mr. Femi Adebowale of Adebowale Legal Associates, has prepared the requisite documentation to substantiate this claim, including a notarized will and corporate partnership records.  \n\nUpon successful validation, the funds will be transferred to your nominated account via SWIFT. The disbursement will occur in two phases:  \n1. Initial Transfer: $10,000,000.00 (USD) within 7‚Äì9 business days of affidavit submission.  \n2. Remaining Balance: $26,000,000.00 (USD) following confirmation of the first transfer.  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 20% of the total ($7,200,000.00 USD).  \n- My Share: 65% (covers legal/administrative costs).  \n- Charitable Allocation: 10% to UNICEF and M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res.  \n- Operational Expenses: 5% (bank fees, notary charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nKindly confirm your interest by reply, providing a secure contact number and fax for detailed documentation. All correspondence will remain confidential under attorney-client privilege.  \n\nFor immediate clarification, I may be reached at:  \n- Mobile: +234 706 555 0123  \n- Office: +234 1 277 5555 (Ext. 882)  \n- Email: jcabutti@fcbn.com.ng  \n- LinkedIn: [Joseph Cabutti ‚Äì FCBN Audit Division](https://linkedin.com/in/jcabutti-fcbn)  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to meet the statutory deadline. I trust this proposition aligns with your discretion and professionalism.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nSenior Auditing Consultant  \nFirst Continental Bank of Nigeria  \nPlot 20 Silver Crescent, Enugu, Nigeria  \n‚Äî Member, Nigerian Institute of Auditors (NIA)  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

This email is a classic example of a phishing scam, specifically a type of scam known as a \"Nigerian 419 scam\" or \"advance fee scam.\" Here's why:\n\n1. **Unsolicited and vague**: The email is unsolicited, and the sender claims to have found you through your \"professional expertise,\" but doesn't specify what that expertise is or how they found you.\n2. **Too good to be true**: The proposal involves a large sum of money ($36 million) that you can supposedly claim with minimal effort, which is an unrealistic and suspicious offer.\n3. **Urgency and time pressure**: The email creates a sense of urgency, stating that the funds will be transferred to the National Trust Fund for Humanitarian Relief if you don't act quickly. This is a tactic to create a false sense of urgency and prompt you into making a hasty decision.\n4. **Request for personal and financial information**: The email asks you to provide a secure contact number, fax, and other personal details, which could be used for identity theft or other malicious purposes.\n5. **Suspicious compensation structure**: The proposed compensation structure is unusual and raises suspicions. The sender claims to be a senior auditing consultant, but the structure suggests that they are more interested in personal gain than in following proper banking procedures.\n6. **Lack of verification**: There is no way to verify the authenticity of the email, the sender's identity, or the existence of the First Continental Bank of Nigeria (FCBN) or the unclaimed estate.\n7. **Red flags in the email**: The email contains several red flags, including the use of a generic greeting (\"Dear Mr. Thompson\"), the lack of a clear and concise explanation of the proposal, and the inclusion of a LinkedIn profile link that may be fake.\n\nTo handle this email, you should:\n\n1. **Delete the email**: Do not respond to the email or engage with the sender in any way.\n2. **Report the email**: You can report the email to your email provider's abuse department or to a spam reporting service, such as Spam@uce.gov (for US residents).\n3. **Be cautious**: Be cautious when receiving unsolicited emails, especially those that promise large sums of money or require you to provide personal and financial information.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always prioritize your online security and be wary of suspicious emails and proposals."

My team oversees the resolution of dormant accounts and unclaimed estates under Burkina Faso‚Äôs Financial Code ¬ß12.4 (Unclaimed Assets Act).  \n\nIn 2001, an account was opened under the name Mr. Henri Dubois (a French national) with a balance of USD 22,600,000.00 (Twenty-Two Million Six Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Regrettably, Mr. Dubois and his immediate family perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash near Paris on July 25, 2000. Despite exhaustive efforts, no lawful next of kin has been identified.  \n\nPer BOA policy, dormant accounts lacking claimants for over 10 years are transferred to the national treasury. However, Article 7(b) of Burkina Faso‚Äôs Unclaimed Assets Act permits foreign nationals to petition for inheritance rights if no local beneficiaries exist.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the lawful beneficiary to claim the funds.  \n2. BOA will facilitate the transfer to your nominated account after verification.  \n3. Compensation distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated to administrative/legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by BOA for charitable initiatives.  \n\nRequired Documentation:  \n- Bank account details (SWIFT/BIC code, IBAN, and branch address).  \n- Copy of government-issued identification (e.g., passport).  \n- A notarized affidavit confirming your status as a foreign beneficiary.  \n\nKindly respond within 10 business days to avoid account forfeiture. All correspondence must be sent to foreign.remittance@boa.bf or via fax at +226 25 44 5679.  \n\nFor security, this case is classified under Reference #BOA-1098D.

My name is Elizabeth Koffi-Annan, daughter of Mr. Koffi Anan, the former United Nations Secretary-General. I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I obtained your contact through a reputable international business directory while seeking a trustworthy partner abroad.  \n\nDue to my father‚Äôs prominent position, I must act discreetly regarding a personal matter. Several years ago, I deposited $22 million USD in a secured, coded account at the Bank of Africa in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. These funds were allocated to me privately and remain separate from my family‚Äôs affairs. However, transferring such a sum internationally without attracting scrutiny‚Äîparticularly while my father‚Äôs political legacy remains sensitive‚Äîrequires cautious collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this, I propose two mutual agreements:  \n1. Marriage of Convenience: A legal court wedding in your country to facilitate my relocation and fund transfer without familial interference.  \n2. Business Partnership: Your assistance in investing these funds into sustainable infrastructure or real estate ventures within your nation.  \n\nIn return, you would receive 20% of the total amount ($4.4 million USD) for your partnership and 10% ($2.2 million USD) to cover related expenses. My legal advisor, Mr. Jean-Luc B√©di√© (barrister.bedie@africalegal.ci), holds all documentation and will verify the account‚Äôs legitimacy upon your consent.  \n\nThis request is urgent, as I aim to finalize arrangements before my father‚Äôs associates inquire about the funds. Kindly reply with your direct phone number and availability for a brief call to discuss next steps. All communication must remain confidential to protect both parties.  \n\nI understand this is unconventional, but I trust you will treat my situation with empathy and professionalism.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nMiss Elizabeth Koffi-Annan  \nDaughter of H.E.

I represent the estate of the late Mr. Nicolas Lef√®vre (1948‚Äì2001), a French national and former engineering consultant for TotalEnergies S.E. in West Africa.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Lef√®vre, his spouse, and their two children tragically perished in a collision outside Dakar. As court-appointed executor, I have spent 22 months conducting due diligence to locate surviving kin, including collaboration with French consular authorities and private investigators. To date, no legitimate heirs have been identified.  \n\nA fiduciary account holding ‚Ç¨14.7 million (approx. $15.8 million USD) remains at Banque R√©gionale de Commerce International (BRCI) under case BRCI/EST/2001-0452. Per Senegalese probate law, these assets will escheat to the state on November 15, 2023 unless a lawful beneficiary is confirmed.  \n\nGiven your professional standing and shared nationality with the deceased, I propose a strictly confidential arrangement:  \n- You would be documented as Mr. Lef√®vre‚Äôs designated beneficiary via a retroactive codicil.  \n- Funds would be disbursed through BRCI‚Äôs inheritance protocols, supervised by the Dakar Probate Court.  \n- Compensation: 55% allocated to you, 45% retained for legal fees, taxes, and administrative costs.  \n\nRequired for Compliance:  \n1. Full legal name (as per government-issued ID)  \n2. Current contact address and mobile number  \n3.

This is a common tactic to create a false sense of urgency and prompt you into taking action without fully thinking it through.\n4. **Request for personal and financial information**: The email asks for your full legal name, contact address, mobile number, and a scanned copy of your passport.

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, a retiree based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I apologize for reaching out unsolicited, but I identified your credentials through a professional directory and believe you may be suited to assist with a time-sensitive charitable endeavor.  \n\nI am currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer, and my prognosis is limited. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (deceased 2002), was a logistics consultant who worked extensively in West Africa. During his career, he established a trust fund valued at ¬£11,800,000.00 (eleven million eight hundred thousand British pounds) through Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. This fund remains under legal review due to compliance complexities linked to his former engagements.  \n\nGiven my health and the lack of immediate heirs, I seek to allocate these resources to vetted organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: refugee aid, environmental conservation, and youth/widow support programs. Due to legal restrictions tied to the trust‚Äôs provenance, I require a fiduciary intermediary to oversee disbursement in accordance with international charitable guidelines.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Fund Origin: Legally documented inheritance (probate case #02-4786C, Puerto Rico Superior Court).  \n- Fiduciary Agent: Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. (London HQ).  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Structured philanthropic grant (no personal financial obligation required).  \n\nIf you are willing to collaborate on this initiative, kindly reply to acarlos.foundation@mailservice.pr within 72 hours to discuss due diligence steps. Confidentiality is paramount, as premature publicity could jeopardize the process.  \n\nThank you for considering this request. Time permitting, I aim to finalize arrangements by month‚Äôs end.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nMrs. Alondra Jose-Carlos  \nSan Juan, Puerto Rico  \nNote: All medical and legal documentation available upon verified inquiry.  \n\n---  \nThis email is sent from an unmonitored account.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Unsolicited contact**: The email is unsolicited, and the sender claims to have found your credentials through a professional directory. This raises concerns about how they obtained your contact information and their motives.\n2. **Urgency and emotional appeal**: The email creates a sense of urgency and tugs at your heartstrings by mentioning the sender's terminal illness and desire to allocate funds to charitable causes. This is a common tactic used by scammers to create a false sense of urgency and emotional connection.\n3. **Lack of personal connection**: You don't know the sender, and there's no established relationship or context for this email.\n4. **Unverifiable claims**: The email makes claims about a trust fund, a deceased husband, and a fiduciary agent, but there's no way to verify these claims without further investigation.\n5. **Request for confidentiality**: The email asks you to keep the matter confidential, which could be a tactic to prevent you from seeking advice or verifying the claims.\n6. **Unmonitored account**: The email is sent from an unmonitored account, which makes it difficult to respond or ask questions.\n\nGiven these red flags, I would recommend the following course of action:\n\n1. **Do not respond**: Do not reply to the email or engage with the sender. This will help prevent any potential scams or phishing attempts.\n2. **Verify the claims**: If you're interested in verifying the claims, try to find independent information about the trust fund, the fiduciary agent, and the sender's identity. However, be cautious not to disclose any sensitive information or engage with the sender.\n3. **Report the email**: You can report the email to your email provider's abuse department or mark it as spam. This will help prevent others from receiving similar emails.\n4. **Seek advice**: If you're unsure about how to handle the email or have concerns about its legitimacy, consider seeking advice from a trusted professional, such as a lawyer or a financial advisor.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with unsolicited emails, especially those that involve financial or charitable transactions."

My name is Dr. James Ngola, formerly the senior financial advisor to the late President Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I am writing to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive matter requiring urgent international collaboration.  \n\nFollowing the tragic assassination of President Kabila on January 16, 2001, I was entrusted with overseeing a portion of government funds generated through legal diamond exports under his administration. These funds, totaling $25 million USD, were stored in diplomatic containers and relocated to a private security vault in Accra, Ghana, under my supervision. Due to ongoing political instability in the region, I am now seeking a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the secure transfer and investment of these assets.  \n\nYour name was recommended to me by Mr. Thomas Whitaker, a mutual contact within the International Chamber of Commerce, who described you as a reputable professional with expertise in cross-border financial management. While the full context of this arrangement was withheld from him for security reasons, I trust his judgment implicitly.  \n\nHere is the proposed arrangement:  \n1. Asset Transfer: The funds (currently held as gold-backed certificates at GhanaSafe Securities Ltd.) will be transferred to a designated account under your name.  \n2. Compensation: You will retain 20% of the total sum ($5 million USD) for your assistance.  \n3. Investment: The remaining 75% ($18.75 million USD) will be allocated to joint ventures in your country, with your guidance.  \n4. Expenses: A 5% contingency fund ($1.25 million USD) will cover administrative costs, including legal fees and secure transport.  \n\nAll documentation‚Äîincluding certificates of deposit, customs clearance records, and diplomatic authorization letters‚Äîis prepared and verifiable. This transaction carries no legal risk, as the assets were formally declared to international auditors in 2000 and are unrelated to current DRC governance.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+233 55 712 3091) by Friday, October 27. I will then arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the paperwork and finalize logistics. Due to the time-sensitive nature of this matter, discretion is paramount.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former DRC Presidential Office)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233 55 712 3091  \n\nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

Unsolicited contact: You did not initiate contact with Mr. Kaburo Musa or the bank, and you have no prior relationship with them.\n2.

Lack of verification: There is no way to verify the authenticity of the email, the bank, or Mr. Kaburo Musa.\n4. Request for sensitive information: The email asks for your personal and financial information, which is a red flag.\n5. Urgency and secrecy: The email creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the need for secrecy, which is a common tactic used by scammers to create a false sense of importance and to prevent you from seeking advice or verifying the information.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle this email is to:\n\n1. Delete it: Do not respond to the email or engage with the sender in any way.\n2. Report it: You can report the email to your email provider's abuse department or to a spam reporting service.\n3. Ignore any follow-up emails: If you receive any follow-up emails, ignore them and do not respond.\n4. Be cautious: Be aware that scammers may try to contact you through other means, such as phone or social media, so be cautious and do not provide any personal or financial information to unknown individuals.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is. Legitimate businesses and organizations do not typically contact individuals out of the blue with unsolicited offers of large sums of money."

The message is also vague about the specifics of the collaboration and the funds involved.\n2. **Red flags of a scam**: The email contains several red flags that are common in phishing scams or advance-fee scams. These include:\n\t* A claim of having access to large sums of money that need to be transferred or secured.\n\t* A request for confidentiality and discretion, which can be used to create a sense of urgency and prevent you from verifying the sender's claims.\n\t* A request for you to contact the sender directly via email or phone, which can be used to establish a direct communication channel and potentially extract sensitive information from you.\n3. **Lack of verification**: There is no way to verify the sender's identity or their claims about being a former senior official in the Ministry of Finance of Afghanistan.\n4. **Security concerns**: The email claims to be encrypted, but this is likely a false claim. ProtonMail is a legitimate email service that offers end-to-end encryption, but this does not guarantee the authenticity of the sender or the email's contents.\n\n**Appropriate way to handle it:**\n\n1. **Do not respond**: Do not respond to the email or contact the sender directly. This can help prevent you from being drawn into a potential scam.\n2. **Report the email**: Report the email to your email provider's abuse department or mark it as spam. This can help prevent others from receiving similar emails.\n3. **Verify the sender's identity**: If you are concerned about the legitimacy of the email, try to verify the sender's identity through official channels, such as contacting the Afghan Ministry of Finance or a reputable organization that works with Afghan refugees.\n4. **Be cautious of similar emails**: Be cautious of similar emails that claim to offer lucrative opportunities or request your assistance in securing large sums of money.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with unsolicited emails that contain red flags of a scam."

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am reaching out regarding a confidential financial matter that requires a trustworthy partner. While I understand this contact is unexpected, I was compelled to write after reviewing your professional background on LinkedIn, which suggests you have expertise in international business development.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Albert Edmond, was a former Minister of Infrastructure in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. Before his assassination in 2019, he secured $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in a bonded vault with Securit√© Afrique SA, a licensed security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son √âmile (23) and I seek to transfer these funds abroad for safekeeping and investment.  \n\nWe propose the following arrangement:  \n\n1. Asset Transfer: The funds will be shipped via diplomatic courier to your address as ‚Äúindustrial machinery parts‚Äù to avoid scrutiny. A notarized Power of Attorney will authorize you to receive the shipment.  \n2. Investment Strategy: We aim to allocate the capital across three sectors in your country:  \n   - Commercial real estate (shopping centers/office spaces)  \n   - Logistics/transportation (last-mile delivery fleet)  \n   - Hospitality (midscale boutique hotels, not 5-star)  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 20% ($1,700,000) of the total for your assistance. The remainder will be managed jointly through a registered holding company.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to AML regulations, with legal documentation prepared by our family attorney, Mr. Kwame Adjekum (kwame.adjekum@cabinet-legal.ci). Due to security concerns, I regret that we cannot communicate by phone until mutual verification is complete.  \n\nIf agreeable, kindly reply within 72 hours to monica.edmond@pmail.ci with a scanned copy of your government-issued ID and a secure mailing address.

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am reaching out to you under strict confidentiality to propose a legitimate business opportunity that requires your cooperation.  \n\nDuring a routine audit review, I identified a dormant account with a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four Dollars, Twenty-Two Cents). The account belongs to Mr. Pierre Johnson, a German national and former client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a motor accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate his next of kin or legal heirs, no beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nAs the account holder left no will and has no documented relatives, our institution is legally obligated to transfer the funds to a verified beneficiary or release them to the state after a statutory period. To prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating with you to process a lawful claim as Mr. Johnson‚Äôs designated next of kin. All documentation, including the death certificate, account records, and legal affidavits, has been prepared to facilitate this process.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds will be transferred through our affiliate, Citibank Online (Madrid Branch), directly to your nominated account.  \n- Continental Bank‚Äôs internal approval is required to initiate the transfer, which I will oversee.  \n- The process adheres to international banking protocols and carries no financial risk to you.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via reply. I will then provide a step-by-step outline of the claim procedure. For urgent inquiries, you may contact me directly at +229 97 45 63 21 (my private line) or via encrypted email: myussuf@continentalbank.bj.  \n\nThis matter is time-sensitive, as unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture under Beninese law after 31 December 2023.

Our records indicate a dormant account belonging to Mr. Allen Duke, a valued client who held a deposit of US$4,800,000.00 (Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Tragically, Mr. Duke, along with his spouse and only child, passed away in an aviation incident on January 30, 2000.  \n\nUnder the UK Financial Conduct Authority‚Äôs Dormant Account Policy (Section 4.2), beneficiaries or next of kin must claim such funds within a 25-year period. With the deadline approaching in January 2025, and no surviving relatives having come forward, Barclays is legally obligated to escalate this matter for resolution.  \n\nAs part of our due diligence, I propose a confidential collaboration:  \n1. You would act as the appointed beneficiary, leveraging documentation from Mr. Duke‚Äôs file (including account ledgers and notarized affidavits) to validate the claim.  \n2. Barclays‚Äô legal team would fast-track the inheritance process, requiring only a signed affidavit of kinship and identity verification (passport/ID).  \n3. Funds would be disbursed within 10 business days of claim approval, with proceeds shared 60% to you and 40% retained by the bank to cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nThis transaction adheres to GDPR confidentiality standards and carries no financial risk, as all costs will be deducted post-transfer.  \n\nFor immediate action, contact me via:  \nüìß Email: chris.swales@barclays-uk.co  \nüìû Direct Line: +44 20 7946 0731 (Mon‚ÄìFri, 9 AM‚Äì5 PM GMT)  \nüì† Secure Fax: +44 20 7946 0745  \n\nKindly respond by 5:00 PM GMT on Friday, 24 November 2023, to initiate proceedings.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Urgency and pressure**: The email creates a sense of urgency, stating that the deadline for claiming the inheritance is approaching, and you need to respond quickly. This is a common tactic used by scammers to create a false sense of urgency and prompt you into taking action without thinking twice.\n2. **Unsolicited contact**: You didn't initiate contact with Barclays Bank, and they didn't have any prior communication with you about this alleged inheritance. Legitimate banks and financial institutions usually don't contact people out of the blue with such sensitive information.\n3. **Lack of personal connection**: The email claims that you're being asked to act as the appointed beneficiary, but there's no explanation of how you're related to Mr. Allen Duke or why you're being chosen for this role.\n4. **Suspicious proposal**: The proposal involves you sharing the inheritance with the bank, which is unusual and raises suspicions. Legitimate banks don't typically offer to share inheritance funds with individuals.\n5. **Request for personal documents**: The email asks you to provide a copy of your government-issued ID, which is a common tactic used by scammers to obtain sensitive information.\n6. **Unverifiable contact information**: The email provides a generic email address, phone number, and fax number, but these can be easily spoofed or fake.\n\nTo handle this email, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Do not respond**: Ignore the email and do not respond to it.\n2. **Do not provide personal documents**: Never provide sensitive information, such as your ID or passport, to unknown individuals or organizations.\n3. **Verify the authenticity**: If you're concerned about the legitimacy of the email, contact Barclays Bank directly using a phone number or email address you find on their official website. They will be able to verify whether the email is genuine or not.\n4. **Report the scam**: You can report the email to the relevant authorities, such as the UK's Action Fraud or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US.\n5. **Be cautious**: Be aware of similar scams and always be cautious when receiving unsolicited emails or messages that ask for personal information or money.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is.

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the late Head of State of Nigeria (1993‚Äì1998). I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Association of Commerce, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of assisting with a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing my husband‚Äôs passing in 1998, I have faced sustained pressure from governmental authorities seeking to confiscate assets linked to his estate. Recent audits have uncovered approximately $700 million in overseas accounts, which the current administration claims were improperly acquired. While I dispute these allegations, my ability to challenge them is restricted due to ongoing surveillance and travel restrictions imposed on me.  \n\nCurrently, $35 million USD is held in a private security vault under a confidential agreement with a European fiduciary firm. Due to my legal status, I am unable to access these funds directly. I seek your assistance in transferring this amount to a secure bank account under your name. Upon successful completion, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million) as compensation, with the remainder allocated to my relocation and legal defense.  \n\nMy family‚Äôs legal counsel, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu (aliyu_legal@abachalawfirm.ng; +234 809 876 5432), will coordinate all documentation and logistics. Due to monitoring of my communications, I request that you respond directly to this email (mariam.abacha@mariamabacha.net) and copy barrister.aliyu@abachalawfirm.ng to initiate proceedings.  \n\nThis request is made in strict confidence. Should you decline, I ask only for your discretion, as publicity would exacerbate my current situation.

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your collaboration in resolving a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing President Kabila‚Äôs tragic assassination on January 16, 2001, during a private meeting to review proceeds from state-managed diamond exports, I was entrusted with overseeing $100 million USD in diplomatic assets. These funds, stored in three sealed diplomatic containers, were routed through Zimbabwe and later dispersed to ensure their security during the ensuing political instability.  \n\nA portion of these funds, amounting to $25 million USD, was converted to gold reserves and deposited under my authority with Accra Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed security firm in Ghana, where I currently reside as a political refugee. Due to my status, I require a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the transfer of these assets into a secure international account for future investment.  \n\nYour name was recommended by Mr. Daniel Clarke, a member of the International Chamber of Commerce based in Accra, who attested to your professionalism and discretion. While he is unaware of the specifics, he confirmed your reliability for such a critical undertaking.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will act as the beneficiary of the funds, enabling their transfer to your account.  \n2. Upon successful clearance, you will retain 20% ($5 million USD) as compensation.  \n3. The remaining 75% will be allocated to long-term investments in your country under your guidance.  \n4. A 5% reserve will cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nAll documentation, including certificates of deposit, diplomatic seals, and ownership affidavits, is secured. The funds carry no public record, as they were designated for presidential use and bypassed official channels.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly respond to this email or contact me directly at +233-27-195-3892 (Ghana) within 48 hours. I will arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the documentation and finalize the transfer. Your discretion is paramount, as premature disclosure could jeopardize this transaction.  \n\nI look forward to your urgent reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former)  \nOffice of the President, DRC (1997‚Äì2001)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233-27-153-2915  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

My name is Mrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi, widow of the late Dr. Jonas Savimbi, former leader of the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA). After years of silence, I am compelled to seek your assistance due to extraordinary circumstances.  \n\nMy husband, who survived numerous attempts on his life, was tragically killed in 2002 during a clash with Angolan government forces. Before his passing, he secured USD 16,400,000.00 (Sixteen Million Four Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in the form of precious assets, deposited with a private security firm in South Africa. This fund was accrued through legitimate sales of gold and diamonds during his leadership.  \n\nFollowing his death, my family and I faced relentless persecution. While my eldest son and I remain under house arrest in Angola, my younger son, Peter Savimbi, escaped to South Africa under political asylum. Regrettably, South African law restricts refugees from conducting major financial transactions, leaving him unable to claim the assets.  \n\nI am reaching out to you‚Äîguided by faith and necessity‚Äîto request your partnership. We propose appointing you as the legal beneficiary to facilitate the transfer. In return, you will retain 30% of the total sum for your cooperation, with the remaining 70% allocated to securing my family‚Äôs future upon our release.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact my son directly via:  \nEmail: petersavimbi8@webmail.co.za  \nAlternate Email: petersavimbi5@webmail.co.za  \nPhone: +27 72 434 0319 (South Africa)  \n\nRequired Details for Documentation:  \n1.

Fax Number (if applicable)  \n\nThis arrangement is legally binding and risk-free, contingent on mutual trust and confidentiality. Time is critical, as we aim to resolve this matter discreetly before year-end.  \n\nMay God‚Äôs grace guide us in this endeavor.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nMrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi  \nOn behalf of the Savimbi Family  \n\n---  \nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed estate linked to Mr. Allen Duke, a valued client of our institution who, tragically, passed away in an aviation accident on January 30, 2000, alongside his immediate family.  \n\nPer our records, Mr. Duke held a deposit of USD 4,800,000.00 (Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) at the time of his demise. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin or lawful beneficiaries, no claimants have surfaced in over six years. Under UK banking regulations (Section 17.4 of the Financial Administration Act), dormant accounts exceeding a five-year unclaimed period are subject to forfeiture to the Crown Estate.  \n\nGiven the urgency of this matter, I propose a confidential collaboration to secure these funds before the statutory deadline of October 31, 2006. As the account‚Äôs overseeing officer, I possess full access to Mr. Duke‚Äôs file, including notarized documentation validating his lack of surviving heirs. By acting as a designated beneficiary, we can legally redirect these assets under probate court guidelines.  \n\nKey Process Overview:  \n1. Submission of a sworn affidavit (prepared by our legal team) confirming your status as Mr. Duke‚Äôs distant relative.  \n2. Transfer of funds to a jointly nominated offshore account within 7‚Äì10 business days.  \n3. A 50% equitable distribution of the net proceeds, following deduction of administrative fees (~3.5%).  \n\nThis arrangement carries no financial or legal risk, as all due diligence checks have been pre-cleared internally. Strict confidentiality is assured.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email at [chris.swales@katamail.com](mailto:chris.swales@katamail.com) and provide a direct contact number for urgent discussion.

This email is a classic example of a phishing scam, specifically a type of scam known as an \"advance fee scam\" or \"419 scam.\" Here's why:\n\n1. Unsolicited contact: The email is from an unknown sender, claiming to be the widow of a former leader of a political organization. You did not initiate contact with her, and she has no reason to know you or your financial situation.\n2. Unrealistic story: The story is dramatic and attention-grabbing, but it's likely fabricated. The email claims that the sender's husband was a leader of a political organization and had millions of dollars in assets, which is a common trope in these types of scams.\n3. Request for assistance: The sender asks for your help in transferring the funds, claiming that her son is unable to access the account due to his refugee status. This is a common tactic used to gain your trust and involvement.\n4. Promise of a large sum of money: The email promises you a significant amount of money (30% of $16.4 million) in exchange for your assistance. This is a clear attempt to entice you into participating in the scam.\n5. Request for personal information: The email asks for your full legal name, residential address, and contact information, which is a red flag. Legitimate organizations would not ask for this information via email, especially not in an unsolicited message.\n6. Encryption claim: The email claims that all communications are encrypted for security, which is likely a false statement. Legitimate organizations would not make such claims in an email, and encryption would not be necessary for a simple email exchange.\n\nTo handle this email, you should:\n\n1. Delete it: Do not respond to the email or engage with the sender in any way.\n2. Report it: You can report the email to your email provider's abuse department or to a spam reporting service, such as Spam@uce.gov (for US residents).\n3. Be cautious: Be aware of similar emails and scams, and never provide personal or financial information to unknown senders.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true or requires you to provide sensitive information, it's likely a scam. Always prioritize your online security and be cautious when interacting with unknown senders."

My name is Jones Martin, an independent financial consultant based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive matter involving an unclaimed asset deposit of US$25,000,000.00 held under a diplomatic storage arrangement in Europe.  \n\nBackground of the Transaction:  \nIn 2003, I was contracted by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi) to facilitate a private equity partnership with a Venezuelan oil conglomerate. The investment matured in 2005, and both parties agreed to liquidate the funds in cash to avoid substantial IRS tax liabilities. A senior banker at Mizuhara Trust Bank (New York branch) coordinated the withdrawal and discreet transfer of the funds to a secure storage facility in Luxembourg, registered under a pseudonym.  \n\nThe assets were stored as \"family valuables\" to comply with logistics protocols, with full documentation (certificates, access codes, and keys) entrusted to me. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, leaving the deposit dormant and legally unresolved.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nThe storage facility‚Äôs management has issued repeated notifications since December 2023 to finalize the retrieval process. As the sole surviving executor, I am legally authorized to appoint a designated beneficiary to claim the assets. Due to geopolitical sensitivities and strict confidentiality requirements, I require a trustworthy partner to act as the beneficiary under a pre-negotiated agreement.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n- You will be registered as the temporary beneficiary via a notarized power of attorney (pre-drafted in 2005).  \n- The storage facility in Luxembourg will release the assets upon verification of your identity and my authorization.  \n- A 7% commission (US$1,750,000.00) will be allocated to you for your assistance, with the remainder repatriated to the investor‚Äôs estate.  \n\nThis process is structured to comply with all applicable regulations, and I will provide full documentation for due diligence. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf willing to proceed, kindly confirm your interest by reply email or contact me directly at +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica) or jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com.

I am reaching out to propose a confidential and time-sensitive business arrangement, which was referred to you through a trusted contact at the Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national and longtime resident of Nigeria, Mr. Emre Yƒ±lmaz (deceased), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million. Mr. Yƒ±lmaz was a contractor for several federal projects but passed away unexpectedly four years ago. To date, no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to forfeiture if unclaimed. To resolve this, my colleagues and I propose the following:  \n1.

I am writing to you in my capacity as the legal representative of the late Mr. Neil Frazer, a French national and former private contractor for Shell Petroleum Development Company in Senegal.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Frazer, his spouse, and their three children tragically perished in a vehicular accident near Dakar. Despite exhaustive efforts over the past two years‚Äîincluding liaising with the French Consulate, Interpol, and municipal registries‚Äîno next of kin or valid beneficiaries have been identified for Mr. Frazer‚Äôs estate.  \n\nPrior to his passing, Mr. Frazer held a secured trust account with FinanceSecurity Group (FSG), now valued at $21,000,000 USD. FSG has issued a final notice (Ref: FSG/EST/DAK-1129) requiring the appointment of a beneficiary within 30 business days to avoid forfeiture of the funds under Senegalese unclaimed asset regulations.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose a confidential arrangement wherein you would be presented as the designated beneficiary. All requisite legal documentation, including notarized affidavits and probate court approvals, has been prepared to substantiate this claim. Upon successful transfer, the proceeds would be disbursed as follows:  \n- 60% allocated to my firm for legal fees, administrative costs, and fiduciary obligations.  \n- 40% allocated to you for your cooperation and discretion.  \n\nThis process adheres strictly to Senegalese civil law (Code des Obligations Civiles et Commerciales, Art. 721-725) and international anti-money laundering protocols. Your involvement entails no financial obligation or travel.  \n\nTo initiate proceedings, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Name: (e.g., Pierre Dupont)  \n2. Contact Information: Mobile/landline and current residential address.  \n3. Confirmation of Discretion: Assurance of confidentiality to prevent third-party interference.  \n\nPlease reply urgently via email at barrister.j.douglas@yahoo.com or by phone at +221 77 555 1234 (Dakar office). All correspondence will remain privileged under attorney-client confidentiality.  \n\nRegards,  \nBarrister Jim Douglas  \nDakar Legal Associates  \n12 Rue de la Corniche, Dakar, Senegal  \nTel: +221 33 876 5400 | Fax: +221 33 876 5401  \n\nP.S.

This is an unusually large sum, and the proposed split seems suspicious.\n4. **Urgency and pressure**: The email creates a sense of urgency, with a deadline to respond within 7 days. This is a common tactic to create a false sense of importance and prompt you into acting impulsively.\n5. **Red flags in the email**: The email contains several red flags, such as:\n\t* A Yahoo email address (barrister.j.douglas@yahoo.com) for a supposedly reputable law firm.\n\t* A phone number with a +221 country code (Senegal), but no clear indication of how to verify the law firm's legitimacy.\n\t* A vague reference to Senegalese civil law and international anti-money laundering protocols, which might be intended to sound impressive but lacks specific details.\n\n**Appropriate way to handle it:**\n\n1. **Delete the email**: Do not respond to the email or engage with Barrister Jim Douglas or Dakar Legal Associates.\n2. **Report the email**: You can report the email to your email provider's abuse department or mark it as spam.\n3. **Be cautious**: Be aware that similar scams might target you in the future. Always be skeptical of unsolicited emails or messages that promise large sums of money or inheritance.\n4. **Verify legitimacy**: If you're ever contacted by a law firm or individual claiming to represent a deceased person's estate, verify their legitimacy through reputable sources, such as the relevant country's bar association or a trusted lawyer.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it likely is."

I could not do this because of the situation in the \nworld today not being sure of your reaction.\n \nI am Jones Martin, a \nConsultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese \nBusinessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company \nin Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for \ntermination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and \nthe oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid \npayment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of \nUS Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service IRS. \n \nA special \narrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with \nJapanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to \nterminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with \nan arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they \nprepared and handed over to The banker.\n \nI was directly involved, well \npaid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was \nwithdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault \ndelivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.\n \nThe real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was \ndelivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for \nthe storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys \nwere all handed over to me.\n \nMr. Takashi the Florida businessman was \nplanning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when \nthe unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster \nwhich claimed his life and that of the top banker.

My name is Jones Martin, a licensed financial consultant and broker based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive opportunity involving the collection of a US$25,000,000.00 asset held under a confidential arrangement.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, I was engaged by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi, now deceased) to facilitate an offshore oil investment partnership with a Venezuelan energy firm. The agreement concluded in 2005, with both parties opting to liquidate the investment in cash to minimize tax liabilities. A structured withdrawal was coordinated through a senior banker at Mitsuhashi Trust Bank (New York Branch) to transfer the funds to a secure vault facility in Luxembourg, managed by EuroSafe Financial Holdings.  \n\nThe assets were registered under a pseudonym with a bonded power of attorney, ensuring legal transferability. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina (August 2005), leaving the retrieval documents (storage certificates, access codes, and keys) solely in my custody.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nEuroSafe has issued repeated reminders since December 2023 to finalize the collection process. As the sole surviving authorized party, I am legally obligated to identify a collaborator to assume ownership via the pre-established power of attorney. This requires:  \n1. A notarized affidavit confirming your role as the beneficiary.  \n2. A joint visit to EuroSafe‚Äôs Luxembourg facility to validate credentials.  \n\nTerms & Assurance:  \n- Legality: All documentation complies with international fiduciary regulations.  \n- Confidentiality: A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be executed prior to further disclosure.  \n- Compensation: You will retain 30% of the retrieved funds for your participation; my fee is derived from the remaining portion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply promptly to jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm or call +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica office) to schedule a secure videoconference. Due to the sensitivity of this matter, I regret that I cannot disclose further details publicly.  \n\nKindly treat this correspondence with utmost discretion.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nLicensed Financial Consultant  \nMartin & Associates Consultancy Ltd.  \n12 Harbour Street, Kingston, Jamaica  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198 | Email: jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm  \n\nNote: All identifiers (names, institutions) have been altered for confidentiality.

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am writing to you with a confidential proposal that I believe aligns with your professional expertise. After reviewing your profile, I felt compelled to reach out, as your background suggests you may be well-suited to assist with a sensitive matter.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Jonathan Edmond, was a prominent political figure in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. Before his tragic assassination in 2019, he secured a sum of $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a private security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son, Emmanuel, and I are unable to access these funds directly. We seek to relocate this capital abroad for safekeeping and investment in stable markets.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $8.5M USD held in a bonded consignment under diplomatic protocols.  \n- Objective: Transfer the funds to a trusted partner outside Africa to establish long-term investments.  \n- Proposed Sectors: Real estate development, transportation infrastructure, and hospitality (e.g., luxury hotels).  \n\nWe require a representative to act as the legal consignee for the transfer. The security firm will handle all logistics, including diplomatic clearance and shipment of documentation to your address. In exchange for your assistance, we propose allocating 20% of the total amount ($1.7M USD) to you, with the remainder earmarked for joint ventures in your region.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and availability.  \n2. Provide a secure mailing address to initiate the transfer process.  \n3. Collaborate on drafting an investment plan for the remaining funds.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this matter, I would be grateful for your discretion. You may contact me directly via email at monica.edmond@protonmail.com or by phone at +225 07 87 54 32 11 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred).  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith.

I look forward to your response.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMonica Edmond  \nAbidjan, C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire  \n\nP.S. Should this proposal not align with your current capacity, I kindly request confidentiality. Time is of moderate importance due to contractual obligations with the security firm.  \n\n---  \nThis email is formatted for clarity and realism, including plausible contact methods and procedural references (e.g., CLEE certification) common in international finance.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself.

My name is David Bryan, and I serve as a Senior Portfolio Manager within the Private Wealth division.  \n\nIn 2003, a client (whose identity remains protected per privacy protocols) established a US$6,000,000 investment portfolio through our institution. This arrangement proceeded without incident until November 2004, when the client instructed us to liquidate the entirety of the holdings for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Following strict compliance protocols, we coordinated with an authorized affiliate agency to facilitate the transfer through Nordic SafeGuard Solutions ‚Äì a discreet financial logistics firm specializing in high-value transactions for institutional clients.  \n\nThe client indicated plans to retrieve these funds personally within days of their deposit. However, no further contact was established. In June 2022, Nordic SafeGuard alerted us to the account‚Äôs prolonged dormancy. Subsequent investigations revealed the client had succumbed to cardiac arrest in Cannes, France, in May 2022. French authorities confirmed the identity through dental records, though no next of kin was listed in official documentation.  \n\nOur internal audit confirms you were identified through beneficiary tracing efforts as a potential familial connection. Strict anonymity protocols prevent me from disclosing specifics via conventional channels, hence this direct communication.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs sole custodian of the transaction codes required to release the funds, I propose establishing you as the legal beneficiary through documented kinship ‚Äì a process requiring discreet collaboration. Upon successful transfer, we would equitably divide the assets (60% to you, 40% retained for administrative and compliance obligations). This structure protects both parties from institutional scrutiny given the account‚Äôs confidential nature.  \n\nCritical Security Protocols:  \n‚Ä¢ Respond exclusively to d.bryan@pmail.com  \n‚Ä¢ Mobile contact: +44 7911 123456 (Signal/WhatsApp preferred)  \n‚Ä¢ Never reference this matter through official Kleinwort Benson channels  \n\nThis communication is time-sensitive and will self-retract if unanswered within 14 days.

However, do not use the contact information provided in the email.\n3. **Report the email**: Report the email to your email provider's abuse department and to the relevant authorities, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your local consumer protection agency.\n4. **Be cautious**: Be cautious of any emails that claim to offer you a large sum of money or inheritance, especially if they require you to provide personal or financial information.\n\nRemember, if an email seems too good (or bad) to be true, it probably is.

My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent agricultural entrepreneur and senior member of Zimbabwe‚Äôs Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am reaching out to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, which I will explain briefly.  \n\nFollowing my father‚Äôs assassination by agents of the current government, I was forced to flee Zimbabwe for my safety. Prior to his death, my father secured USD $10,000,000 in the form of precious gemstones within a sealed trunk, deposited with a private security firm in Pretoria, South Africa. These funds were intended for agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini, including machinery procurement and farm development.  \n\nRegrettably, the Zimbabwean government has frozen all family assets and bank accounts, leaving me unable to access these resources. Due to my status as an asylum seeker, South African financial regulations (Section 12B of the Financial Regulations Act) prohibit me from directly claiming or investing such funds. This is why I require a trusted partner abroad to act as the legal recipient.  \n\nProposal:  \n- You would facilitate the transfer of the trunk to your country as the designated consignee.  \n- Upon successful retrieval, 15% ($1,500,000) will be allocated to you for your assistance.  \n- The remainder will fund my relocation and agricultural ventures, with potential opportunities for further collaboration.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the security company has imposed a 30-day deadline before imposing additional storage fees. All documentation, including the deposit certificate and my father‚Äôs will, is prepared for verification.  \n\nConfidentiality is critical, as any disclosure could jeopardize both our safety. For further discussion, please reply to this email or contact me at:  \n- Email: mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au  \n- Phone: +27 63 578 9012 (via secure messaging app Signal, if preferred).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this request and am prepared to provide any evidence needed to establish trust.

Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life.

Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else.

I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. My late husband, Robert White, worked as an expatriate engineer with Chevron in Kenya for over two decades until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution (Banc Europ√©en), which currently holds approximately $7.5 million USD (principal plus accrued interest).  \n\nSince my husband‚Äôs death, this account has remained dormant. Recently, the bank notified me that if the funds are not claimed or re-activated by December 15, 2024, they will be forfeited under their dormant account policy. Regrettably, I am unable to complete this process myself due to critical health circumstances. I am currently undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital and have been advised that my condition is terminal.  \n\nWhile I have donated a significant portion of my estate (including property and assets valued at ~$800,000 USD) to local charities and orphanages in Kenya and Kinshasa, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to international faith-based organizations, homeless shelters, and medical missions. My husband‚Äôs relatives, who are not aligned with our Christian values, have repeatedly attempted to seize control of these assets, leaving me unable to trust them with this responsibility.  \n\nWhy I Am Reaching Out to You:  \nThe bank requires a trustee to legally authorize the reactivation and transfer of these funds to verified charities. As a member of my church‚Äôs outreach network, your name was provided to me as a potential individual of integrity who may assist in this matter. If you are willing, I will instruct my attorney, Mr. Daniel Clarke (Clarke & Partners Legal Associates, Brussels), to liaise with you. He will provide:  \n1. A notarized authorization letter naming you as the temporary trustee.  \n2. Bank contact details and transfer protocols.  \n3. Documentation verifying the legitimacy of the account and my medical condition.  \n\nDue to my inability to speak (a result of my treatment) and concerns about family interference, all communication must remain via email. I sincerely apologize for the abrupt nature of this request and understand if you are unable to assist. However, time is of the essence to prevent the funds from being seized.  \n\nShould you agree to help, kindly respond to this email, and my attorney will promptly initiate the process. May God guide your decision.  \n\nWith gratitude,  \nSandra White  \nNairobi General Hospital, Room 214B  \n(Direct correspondence: sandra.white_trust@pmail.com)  \n\nNote: This request is bound by confidentiality.

This arrangement would allow us to:  \n1. Legally transfer the funds to your account.  \n2. Establish a joint venture (e.g., real estate, agriculture, or manufacturing) in your country.  \n3. Formalize our marriage via a civil ceremony to expedite immigration processes.  \n\nFor your support, you will receive 20% of the total sum ($4.4 million), with an additional 10% allocated for administrative expenses. My family‚Äôs legal advisor, Mr. Kwame Osei, will handle all documentation to ensure compliance with international banking regulations.  \n\nConfidentiality is paramount.

As the auditing authority, I am positioned to facilitate the necessary documentation to validate your claim as Mr. Johnson‚Äôs distant relative. Upon approval by our board, the funds will be transferred via SWIFT to your designated account through our affiliate, Citibank Europe PLC (Madrid Branch).  \n\nKey Details for Clarity:  \n- Account Holder: Piere Johnson (Deceased, German citizen, DOB: 15/03/1962)  \n- Funds Origin: Commodity trading dividends (2015‚Äì2019)  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Pre-approved SWIFT transaction (IBAN/BIC required)  \n- Legal Compliance: Full inheritance documentation will be provided to ensure regulatory adherence.  \n\nThis process requires no upfront financial commitment from you.

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a time-sensitive matter requiring international collaboration.  \n\nIn June 1998, following the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha, authorities intercepted six diplomatic trunks containing foreign currencies totaling $197,570,000 during an attempted departure by his associates. As part of the investigative team, I officially declared five trunks to the Federal Government. The sixth trunk, containing $30,000,000, was retained under my supervision to prevent its misuse during the heightened scrutiny of Abacha‚Äôs offshore assets, widely reported by outlets such as The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and the BBC.  \n\nTo secure these funds, the trunk was deposited with SecureLogistics Nigeria Ltd., a licensed security firm, under the classification ‚ÄúPrecious Stones & Jewelry‚Äù to avoid suspicion. With the situation now stabilized, my two trusted colleagues and I seek to relocate this trunk abroad via diplomatic channels, as Nigerian civil service regulations prohibit officials from holding foreign accounts or investments.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will be registered as the consignment‚Äôs beneficiary, with SecureLogistics coordinating its transfer to their affiliate office in [Your Country]. Documentation will reflect your purchase of ‚Äúgemstones‚Äù during a fictitious visit to Nigeria.  \n2. Upon arrival, we will meet to retrieve the trunk. You will open a local account to temporarily hold the funds, after which gradual remittance to your primary accounts can be arranged.  \n3.

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. I am a Dubai-based oil trader currently undergoing treatment for late-stage pancreatic cancer. My physicians estimate I have only weeks remaining.  \n\nIn light of my prognosis, I am prioritizing the allocation of a dormant asset: $35 million USD held in a secure private vault with Al-Mansoori Security Services (Dubai branch) since 2003. This fund was earmarked for disaster relief but remained untouched due to my previous focus on business.  \n\nRecent events have compelled me to act. Earlier this year, I entrusted family members to disburse a separate charitable sum through a Saudi Arabian bank account. Regrettably, they diverted the funds for personal use. This breach of trust necessitates external assistance to ensure the $35 million reaches its intended recipients: verified NGOs supporting tsunami recovery efforts in Southeast Asia and hurricane relief programs in the Gulf Coast (USA).  \n\nYour Role:  \n1. Authorize you as my fiduciary agent to retrieve the deposit from Al-Mansoori Security Services.  \n2. Oversee distribution to pre-vetted organizations (documentation available upon engagement).  \n3. Retain 10% ($3.5M) for administrative costs and time compensation.  \n\nRequired for Legal Processing:  \n- Full name, residential address, and occupation  \n- Direct contact number (e.g., +971-4-910-4953 format)  \n- Government-issued ID copy (scanned) for notarized authorization  \n\nI have instructed my legal advisor, Mr. Faisal Al-Haddad (f.alhaddad@almansoorilegal.ae | Office: +971-4-223-8801), to expedite paperwork upon your confirmation.  \n\nWhile I understand the unusual nature of this request, time constraints prevent conventional vetting. I implore you to respond within 72 hours to avoid probate complications.  \n\nMay Allah grant us both clarity in this endeavor.  \n\nSincerely,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nManaging Director | Yusuf Petrochemicals Group  \nBusiness Bay, Dubai, UAE  \nOffice: +971-4-555-1729  \nNote: All communications are monitored by my medical team due to my condition.",

She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother.

They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late.

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. I apologize for the abrupt nature of this request, but I believe your discretion and goodwill could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother‚Äôs estate.  \n\nMy mother, Ms. Helen Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of Kem Industries, a manufacturing firm based in Johannesburg. Tragically, her business partner, Mr. Philip Brown, was implicated in her death (ruled as poisoning by authorities) and subsequently arrested. Before her passing, my mother secured a $9.8 million deposit with Standard Continental Bank to procure machinery for a new subsidiary. The bank holds strict instructions to transfer these funds only to a designated overseas supplier account‚Äîa detail now complicated by her death.  \n\nDespite being her sole heir, my family has disowned me due to disputes over her estate. They have revoked my access to her properties and frozen my financial resources. During a review of her documents, I discovered this dormant account. The bank cannot release the funds without proof of a valid supplier account, and disclosing her death would risk forfeiting the deposit entirely under the bank‚Äôs compliance policies.  \n\nHere‚Äôs how you can assist:  \n1. Provide a foreign bank account (personal or corporate) to be listed as the ‚Äúsupplier‚Äù recipient.  \n2. Coordinate discreetly to transfer 85% of the funds to me (15% commission is yours) once released.  \n3. Advise on relocation options, as my safety here is compromised.  \n\nI have consulted a legal advisor to ensure this process complies with banking regulations, provided the transfer is framed as fulfilling my mother‚Äôs original intent. Confidentiality is paramount‚Äîthe bank must not learn of her passing until the transaction concludes.  \n\nIf willing to proceed, kindly reply with your contact number and a suitable time to discuss. You may reach me at +27 76 418 3291 or joy.kem@protonmail.com.  \n\nThank you for considering this urgent appeal.

After thorough verification of your credentials, I believe you are well-suited to assist in finalizing an outstanding contractual matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2022, my department oversaw a mining infrastructure project managed by a foreign contractor. Due to administrative adjustments during the project‚Äôs execution, an over-invoiced balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) remains unallocated.

We seek a reputable international partner to act as the beneficiary for this transfer. Upon confirmation of your participation, our legal team will file a ‚ÄúTransfer of Rights‚Äù application with the Ministry of Justice to designate your entity as the successor to the original contractor.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Your Share: 25% (USD 2,625,000) for facilitating the transfer.  \n- Our Share: 70% retained for departmental reallocation.  \n- Remaining 5%: Covers administrative fees, including notarization and banking charges.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant under South African Treasury Regulation 16.4.3 (Offshore Remittances for Contractual Obligations).

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch by the late Engr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  \n\nBackground of the Matter:  \nIn August 1996, Engr. Lee Seunghyo opened a 12-month fixed deposit account valued at USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars). Upon maturity in 1997, routine notifications were dispatched to his registered address but received no response. Subsequent investigations revealed that Engr. Lee tragically perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam (August 1997). Further inquiries confirmed he died intestate (without a will) and left no declared next of kin or beneficiaries in his bank records or NNPC employment documents.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed funds exceeding 10 years are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. However, as the account‚Äôs custodian, I have secured a Court Order of Mandamus (Case Ref: FHC/L/CP/342/2024) to identify a lawful beneficiary before the impending deadline of October 31, 2024.  \n\nProposal for Collaboration:  \nTo prevent these funds from reverting to government custody, I propose nominating you as the deceased‚Äôs next of kin. As a foreign national, you qualify to claim the deposit, as local regulations prohibit direct transfers to Nigerian accounts for dormant USD holdings.  \n\nRequired Steps:  \n1. Provide the following details to initiate legal documentation:  \n   - Full Name & Residential Address  \n   - Date of Birth & Occupation  \n   - Contact Telephone Number (for verification)  \n\n2. Our retained legal team, Adeoye & Associates Legal Practitioners, will draft a notarized affidavit and probate documents to establish your status as the beneficiary.  \n\n3. Funds will be transferred to your designated offshore account upon approval.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (facilitation and risk coverage)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (pre-deducted prior to disbursement)  \n\nConfidentiality & Assurance:  \nThis transaction is protected under attorney-client privilege. My position as Credit Manager ensures all processes comply with internal protocols. Strict discretion is required to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nAct Now:  \nKindly respond within 72 hours to secure your slot. Delays risk forfeiture of the funds.  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: dobidima@firsttrustbankng.com  \n- Office Line: +234 1 904 7563 (Ext. 112)  \n- Bank Address: FirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC, 24 Marina Road, Lagos Island, Lagos.  \n\nYour prompt attention to this mutually beneficial opportunity is appreciated.  \n\nYours faithfully,  \nMr. Donald Ofu Obidima  \nCredit Control Manager  \nFirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC  \nConfidentiality Note: This communication is intended solely for the addressee.

This is a tactic to create a false sense of urgency and pressure you into acting quickly without thinking.\n4. **Request for personal and financial information**: The email asks for your personal and financial information, which is a red flag. Legitimate organizations would not ask for such information via email.\n5. **Suspicious terms and conditions**: The email proposes a suspicious division of the funds, with the sender taking a large share and asking you to pay for \"legal and operational costs.\"\n6. **Poor grammar and formatting**: The email contains grammatical errors and formatting issues, which is unusual for a professional email from a bank.\n\nTo handle this email, you should:\n\n1. **Delete it**: Do not respond to the email or engage with the sender in any way.\n2. **Report it**: Report the email to your email provider's abuse department or mark it as spam.\n3. **Do not provide any information**: Do not provide any personal or financial information to the sender.\n4. **Be cautious**: Be cautious of similar emails or scams in the future, and always verify the authenticity of any unsolicited offers or requests.\n\nRemember, if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Legitimate organizations will not contact you out of the blue with unsolicited offers or requests for personal and financial information."

My name is Lydia Johnson, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. My late husband, Major Stephen Johnson, served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia during his administration. Following the president‚Äôs exile and the escalation of political unrest in Monrovia, my family has faced severe hardship.  \n\nTragically, my husband was killed by armed rebels during a targeted attack six months ago. Fearing for our safety, I fled Monrovia with my son David (23) and four daughters. With the aid of a security contact, we crossed the border into Dakar, Senegal, where we currently reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly deposited US$7 million with a private financial institution here in Dakar (verified as Banque de S√©curit√© Financi√®re - Dakar). Due to my deteriorating health (I suffer from advanced diabetes and hypertension) and the instability in Senegal‚Äôs border regions, I urgently seek a trustworthy partner abroad to facilitate the transfer and safekeeping of these funds. This sum represents my family‚Äôs sole remaining asset, as our properties in Liberia were destroyed by rebel forces.  \n\nYour role would involve acting as a designated beneficiary to receive the funds into a secure account in your country. A legal representative here in Dakar will handle all documentation and logistics. For your assistance, you would retain 15% of the total amount, with the remainder allocated to my family‚Äôs resettlement and medical care.  \n\nDue to security concerns, I must emphasize the confidentiality of this request. You may contact me directly at lydia.johnson.assist@gmail.com or through my legal advisor, Mr. Amadou Diallo, at +221 77 854 3291 (Senegal).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this appeal and would gladly provide additional verification through secure channels. Your discretion is paramount, as my children‚Äôs safety depends on swift resolution.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nDakar, Senegal  \n\nNote: All identifiers, including bank names and contacts, are fabricated for training purposes and do not represent real entities or individuals.",

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing under deeply personal and urgent circumstances. I apologize for reaching out unprompted, but I believe your expertise could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother‚Äôs estate.  \n\nBackground:  \nMy mother, Ms. Eliza Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of KemCo Industries, a venture she co-founded with a business partner, Mr. Philip Brown. Tragically, her death was ruled a poisoning, and Mr. Brown was arrested shortly afterward. Though he denied involvement, he coerced my uncles (my mother‚Äôs brothers) into signing agreements that excluded me from her company. I was later removed entirely for opposing their legal counsel, who I suspect colluded in her death.  \n\nRecently, while reviewing her financial records, I discovered a dormant account at First Continental Trust Bank (UK) containing $9,800,000. Per her deposit agreement, these funds were earmarked to purchase machinery for a new subsidiary. However, the bank cannot release the money without proof of a valid ‚Äúcustomer account‚Äù linked to the intended machinery supplier.  \n\nThe Situation:  \nMy relatives have disowned me, seized her property, and threatened my safety. I cannot approach the bank directly, as they believe my mother is still alive (I claimed she is hospitalized to maintain her authority). To access the funds, I urgently need:  \n\n1. A Corporate Bank Account: You would act as the overseas supplier, allowing the bank to transfer the $9.8 million into an account under your name or business.  \n2. Relocation Support: Assistance arranging safe passage from Lagos to your country once the transfer is complete.  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 15% of the total amount ($1,470,000) for your partnership.  \n\nWhy Trust Me?  \nI am my mother‚Äôs only child (born when she was 18), and my father abandoned us before my birth. At 20, I have no family, resources, or legal recourse here. Attached are redacted copies of the bank agreement and my mother‚Äôs death certificate for verification.  \n\nThis request is confidential. If you are willing to help, please reply to joy.kem.assist@gmail.com or call +44 77 5348 1921 by October 15th. I will provide full documentation and coordinate next steps promptly.  \n\nThank you for considering this appeal. Your discretion and compassion could save my life and honor my mother‚Äôs legacy.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMiss Joy Kem  \n(On behalf of the Kem Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: All documentation will be verified through a trusted third-party legal advisor to ensure mutual security.

This is a common tactic used by scammers to create a false sense of importance and prevent you from verifying the information.\n2. **Unsolicited contact**: You didn't initiate contact with Mrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye or her representative, and they have no legitimate reason to contact you.\n3. **Unverifiable claims**: The email makes claims about a deceased person, a large sum of money, and a complex situation, but there's no way to verify these claims.\n4. **Request for personal information**: The email asks for your full name, private contact details, and address, which is a common phishing tactic to gather sensitive information.\n5. **Promise of a large sum of money**: The email promises you a significant amount of money (20% of $21.5 million) for your assistance, which is an unrealistic and suspicious offer.\n6. **Lack of transparency**: The email doesn't provide any clear information about the transaction, the security firm, or the legal process involved.\n\nTo handle this email, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Delete the email**: Do not respond to the email or engage with the sender.\n2. **Do not contact the \"Barrister\"**: The contact information provided is likely fake, and responding to it may lead to further scams or phishing attempts.\n3. **Report the email**: If you're concerned about the email, you can report it to your email provider's abuse department or mark it as spam.\n4. **Be cautious of similar emails**: Be aware of similar emails that may use different names, stories, or tactics to scam you.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true or requires you to provide sensitive information, it's likely a scam.

Recent developments by the United Nations and current Liberian authorities have necessitated his potential repatriation for judicial proceedings.  \n\nDue to heightened scrutiny, certain financial assets linked to my family have been restricted by the interim government. Among these is a trust holding $30,270,000.00 (thirty million two hundred and seventy thousand US dollars), originally designated for humanitarian projects. This account is now at risk of seizure, despite its legitimate origins.  \n\nGiven these circumstances, I seek your discretion to act as an intermediary to safeguard these funds. The process would involve transferring the amount temporarily to a secure offshore account under your name, after which my legal team will reclaim it through diplomatic channels. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total sum as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to international compliance standards, and my family‚Äôs legal advisors will oversee every step to ensure legality.

Documentation confirming this event is publicly available via the [CNN Archives](http://edition.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.crash/). Mr. Thompson maintained a dormant account (No. 14-2558-5976) with a balance of USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  \n\nPer Burkina Faso banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after four years.

        "generated text": "\n\nSubject: Urgent Inheritance Claim Opportunity ‚Äì Confidential Business Proposal  \n\nDear Mr. Bennett,  \n\nI am writing to you on behalf of a confidential initiative related to an unclaimed estate at United Bank for Africa (UBA), Ilupeju Branch, Lagos. My name is Martin Chime, and I serve as a senior account manager at this branch. Your contact was discreetly recommended by a trusted intermediary within the Lagos Chamber of Commerce due to your international residency status, which aligns with the requirements of this matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national, Mr. Kemal Aydin (a Turkish contractor residing in Lagos), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million. Mr. Aydin tragically passed away in a road accident later that year, and no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds in the intervening four years. Under Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the government if unclaimed.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs a bank employee, I am ethically obligated to resolve such cases transparently. However, given the lack of claimants, my team (including two senior colleagues) has identified a lawful pathway to transfer these funds to a qualified beneficiary. We propose to formally designate you as Mr. Aydin‚Äôs distant relative and executor of his estate. Your role would involve providing basic documentation (e.g., passport, proof of address) to validate this claim. All internal bank approvals and probate processes have been prearranged to ensure swift execution.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Timeline: 10 business days to finalize documentation and release funds.  \n- Compensation: 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million) for your participation.  \n- Confidentiality: Communication will occur exclusively via secure channels until completion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, confirm your interest by replying to this email or contacting me directly at +234 809 755 4321 (WhatsApp/SMS) or mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com. Upon your confirmation, I will forward a detailed procedural guide, including templates for required affidavits and notarized forms. Our legal team will oversee all filings to ensure compliance with Nigerian probate law.  \n\nThis opportunity is time-sensitive, as regulatory audits of dormant accounts are scheduled in the coming weeks. Rest assured, the process is entirely legal and structured to avoid future disputes.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nBest regards,  \nMartin Chime  \nSenior Account Manager  \nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA), Ilupeju Branch  \nLagos, Nigeria  \nTel: +234 809 755 4321 | Email: mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your assistance in securing a financial legacy left by my late husband.  \n\nPrior to his passing, General Abacha established a USD 25 million deposit with a licensed security firm in Accra, Ghana, designated solely for my family‚Äôs welfare. Due to ongoing investigations by the Nigerian government and international entities‚Äîspearheaded by Swiss lawyer Enrico Monfrini‚Äîinto my late husband‚Äôs estate, we have been unable to access these funds directly. As reported by The Guardian on March 15, 2000, significant assets linked to our family have been frozen or seized, leaving this deposit as our last recourse.  \n\nOur family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has safeguarded my husband‚Äôs final will, which authorizes the release of these funds to a designated foreign trustee. Due to travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of our associates, we require a discreet third party to act as the beneficiary of record. Your role would involve facilitating the transfer of the funds to a secure offshore account under your name, after which the entirety of the sum would be redirected to our family‚Äôs custody.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- The deposit is held at Ghana Trust Securities Ltd., with valid Certificates of Deposit and a Notarized Power of Attorney prepared for your review.  \n- Barrister Musa will meet you in Accra to finalize documentation and accompany you to the depository.  \n- For security, all correspondence must occur via his secure email: tony.musalaw@abachalawfirm.com.ng or phone: +233 55 712 3098 (Ghana office).  \n\nYour Commitment:  \n1. Reply promptly with your full contact details (phone/fax) to enable direct coordination.  \n2. Maintain absolute confidentiality to avoid jeopardizing the process.  \n3. Upon successful transfer, you will receive USD 1.2 million (5% of the total) as compensation.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the depository requires proof of beneficiary status within 21 days to avoid forfeiture. I emphasize that this transaction is lawful and has been structured by our legal team, including consultation with the late Johnnie Cochran, to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nYour discretion and goodwill are paramount. Kindly confirm your willingness to assist by replying to Barrister Musa directly.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Maryam Abacha  \nOn behalf of the Abacha Family Estate  \n\n---  \nNote: This email simulates a real-world scam for training purposes.

My name is Victoria Karegaye, a 22-year-old from Kigali, Rwanda. I am writing to you under extraordinary circumstances and apologize for the sudden nature of this request.  \n\nMy late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the Managing Director of Royal Diamond Corporation in Kigali. Tragically, he and my mother were killed during the civil unrest in 2018, and our family‚Äôs assets were seized or destroyed. Before his passing, he secured a deposit certificate valued at $4.2 million USD under my name at the Bank of Kigali (Ref: BK-DC-4892).  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to the funds. However, due to my current refugee status (UNHCR Case ID: RW-1129-45M), Rwandan monetary policy prohibits me from directly accessing the account. The Central Bank of Rwanda requires a foreign national to act as a trustee to finalize the transfer.  \n\nI have been advised by my legal representative, Mr. Jean-Claude Niyomugabo (Bar License: RBA-6631), to identify a trustworthy individual abroad to facilitate this process. Your contact was recommended through a private directory, and I humbly ask if you would consider assisting me.  \n\nUpon your agreement:  \n1. I will provide notarized documents confirming my identity, the deposit certificate, and legal affidavits.  \n2. The Bank of Kigali will coordinate directly with you to process the transfer.  \n3. You will retain 15% of the total sum ($630,000 USD) as compensation.  \n\nTime is critical, as the bank will revoke the claim if unresolved within 14 business days. Please reply to v.karegaye.assist@zohomail.rw or call +250 7912 34891 (WhatsApp/Signal) at your earliest convenience.  \n\nThank you for your understanding.

This is a common tactic used by scammers to make their emails appear legitimate.\n2. **Urgency and scarcity**: The email creates a sense of urgency by stating that the bank will revoke the claim if unresolved within 14 business days. This is a tactic to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking critically.\n3. **Request for assistance**: The email asks you to act as a trustee to facilitate the transfer of funds, which is a common request in inheritance scams. This is a way for the scammer to gain your trust and eventually ask for money or sensitive information.\n4. **Promise of compensation**: The email offers you a significant amount of money ($630,000 USD) as compensation for your assistance. This is a tactic to make the scam more appealing and enticing.\n5. **Request for confidentiality**: The email asks you to keep the matter confidential, which is a common request in scams. This is a way for the scammer to avoid detection and prevent you from seeking advice from others.\n\nTo handle this email, you should:\n\n1. **Delete the email**: Do not respond to the email or engage with the sender in any way.\n2. **Do not provide any information**: Do not provide any personal or financial information to the sender.\n3. **Report the email**: You can report the email to your email provider's abuse department or to a spam reporting service.\n4. **Be cautious of similar emails**: Be aware of similar emails that may be sent to you in the future, and be cautious of any emails that ask for your assistance or offer you large sums of money.\n\nRemember, if an email seems too good (or bad) to be true, it probably is. Always be cautious when dealing with unsolicited emails, and never provide sensitive information or engage with scammers."

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring urgent cooperation.  \n\nFollowing the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha on June 8, 1998, a routine customs inspection uncovered six diplomatic trunks aboard a chartered flight bound for Saudi Arabia. These trunks contained foreign currency totaling $197,570,000.00 USD. Per protocol, five trunks were declared to the government, while one containing $30,000,000.00 USD was discreetly secured to avoid public scrutiny during ongoing investigations into misappropriated state funds.  \n\nAs reported by The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and The London Times (July 12, 1998), international audits revealed billions linked to Abacha‚Äôs associates. To mitigate risks, the remaining trunk was deposited with a licensed security firm under the classification ‚ÄúPrecious Stones & Jewelry‚Äù to obscure its contents. With recent legal clarity, my two trusted colleagues and I now seek to transfer this asset abroad via diplomatic channels, a process requiring third-party collaboration.  \n\nDue to Nigerian Civil Service regulations prohibiting foreign account ownership, we require your assistance to receive and safeguard these funds internationally. The proposed process is as follows:  \n1. The security firm‚Äôs affiliate in London will dispatch the consignment as ‚Äúpersonal valuables‚Äù under your name.  \n2. Upon arrival, you will retrieve the trunk and deposit the funds into a secure account.  \n3. Gradual remittances to Nigeria will be coordinated, with 20% of the total ($6,000,000.00 USD) allocated as your compensation.  \n\nThis transaction is legally protected under diplomatic immunity and poses no risk to you. Strict confidentiality is imperative.  \n\nContact Details for Further Discussion:  \n- Email: ben.suleman@fedcustoms.gov.ng  \n- Direct Line: +234 809 558 1234  \n- Office Address: Nigerian Customs Service, Cargo Wing, MMIA, Lagos.  \n\nKindly confirm your willingness to proceed via email at your earliest convenience.

Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted.

I am contacting you with a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your immediate attention and utmost discretion.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Henry Whitaker, tragically passed away in a plane crash alongside his immediate family. Following standard protocol, our institution has held his dormant account containing USD $10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) while awaiting claims from a verified next of kin. Regrettably, all documented relatives perished in the same incident, and no legitimate claimant has come forward in over two decades.  \n\nPer ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after a five-year period. However, due to Mr. Whitaker‚Äôs status as a foreign national, Burkina Faso law prohibits local citizens from acting as next of kin for international accounts. To resolve this matter, I propose a confidential partnership wherein you would be formally recognized as the beneficiary to facilitate the fund‚Äôs release.  \n\nTerms of Collaboration:  \n1. Your Role: Provide a non-Burkinabe bank account to receive the funds.  \n2. Distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (as the designated beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated for administrative and legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by my office for fiduciary management.  \n3. Process:  \n   - Submit a brief application to ADB, attesting to your relation to the deceased (template attached).  \n   - Provide your full banking details (account name, number, SWIFT/BIC) and contact information.  \n\nAll documentation will be processed under strict confidentiality. Upon approval, I will personally oversee the transfer and arrange to meet in your country for final disbursement.  \n\nRequired Details for Application:  \n- Full Name & Nationality  \n- Bank Name, Account Number, and SWIFT/BIC Code  \n- Contact Telephone/Fax Number  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: ibrahim.mussa@adb-bf.org  \n- Office Line: +226 25 44 58 90 (Mon‚ÄìFri, 8:00 AM‚Äì4:00 PM GMT)  \n\nThis proposal is time-bound, as the ADB treasury audit cycle concludes on [Date: 30 days from current date]. Immediate action is advised to secure the funds before reclassification.  \n\nI assure you this transaction adheres to all legal protocols and guarantees mutual benefit.

I am reaching out to you in strict confidence to propose a legitimate collaboration that could yield significant mutual benefit.  \n\nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified an escrow account holding $12.5 million (USD).

Upon further investigation, I confirmed it belongs to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and Alaska resident who tragically perished with his family in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records corroborate this event (see [CNN Archives](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list) and [Thompson‚Äôs biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html)).  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account‚Äôs documentation, I confirmed no beneficiaries or next-of-kin claims exist. Per Ghanaian banking regulations, dormant accounts without claimants after 10 years may be transferred to the state. However, as Branch Manager, I retain discretionary authority to expedite the release of funds to a verified foreign next-of-kin.  \n\nProposed Collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Mr. Thompson‚Äôs designated foreign beneficiary.  \n2. I will furnish all necessary legal and financial documentation to validate your claim.  \n3. Funds will be securely transferred to your nominated account.  \n\nThis process is fully compliant with institutional protocols, ensuring zero legal exposure. Upon successful transfer, I propose a 60-40% split in your favor, though terms are negotiable.  \n\nContact Details:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Mobile)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n- Email: godwin.akwesi@kumasi-bank.com.gh  \n\nTime sensitivity is critical, as internal audits occur quarterly. Kindly respond urgently to proceed. All correspondence will remain confidential.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt reply.  \n\nBest regards,  \nMr. Godwin Akwesi  \nBranch Manager  \nKumasi Central Bank  \nGhana",

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as an independent auditing consultant for a prominent financial institution in Nigeria. I am writing to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate requiring urgent intervention.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit in 2022, I discovered an inactive account held by a deceased client, Mr. Alain Mercier, a French industrialist and long-term customer of the bank. Mr. Mercier tragically perished in the Concorde Flight AF4590 crash on July 25, 2000, alongside all passengers. The account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains dormant as no legal will or designated beneficiary was identified.  \n\nExtensive efforts to locate Mr. Mercier‚Äôs next of kin‚Äîincluding coordination with French authorities and private investigators‚Äîhave been unsuccessful. Per Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to federal reserves after 25 years. In this case, the bank‚Äôs board has expedited proceedings to reclassify the funds by Q1 2024, with intentions to allocate them to government-administered trust funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the forfeiture of these funds, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal beneficiary via probate documentation, prepared by my associate attorney, Mr. Kwame Asante (Esq.).  \n2. The bank will authorize an initial transfer of $10,000,000.00 (USD) to your nominated account.  \n3. Upon successful completion, the remaining balance will follow within 7‚Äì9 business days.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- 65% of the total sum allocated to my team.  \n- 20% retained by you as beneficiary.  \n- 10% donated to humanitarian initiatives (mutually agreed upon).  \n- 5% reserved for administrative expenses (legal fees, bank charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- A valid government-issued ID (scanned copy).  \n- Your private contact number and secure email for documentation review.  \n- Confirmation of a non-resident bank account (non-Nigerian) for fund remittance.  \n\nAll processes adhere to legal protocols, including a validated court order (Ref: FHC/ABJ/CS/891/2023) and notarized affidavits. Strict confidentiality is assured.  \n\nPlease reply urgently to secure this opportunity.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nConsulting Auditor  \nBNP Legal & Financial Consulting Group  \nTel: +234 802 555 0193 | Email: jcabutti.consulting@bnplgrp.com  \n\nThis communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Victoria Karegaye, and I am writing to seek your assistance with a sensitive financial matter. I apologize for reaching out unexpectedly, but circumstances have left me with limited options.  \n\nI am a 22-year-old Rwandan national, and my late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the managing director of Royal Diamond Company in Kigali. Tragically, both my parents lost their lives during the civil unrest in Rwanda several years ago. Before his passing, my father secured a deposit certificate at a reputable international bank in my name, valued at $2.75 million USD.  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to these funds. However, due to my current refugee status and strict international banking regulations (specifically AML/KYC policies for displaced persons), I am prohibited from opening an account to access the deposit. The bank has advised me to appoint a trusted representative abroad to facilitate the transfer on my behalf.  \n\nThis is where I humbly ask for your help. If you are willing to act as my intermediary, I will provide all necessary legal documents, including the deposit certificate, death certificates, and court affidavits. In return, you would retain 20% of the total amount as compensation for your assistance.  \n\nPlease note:  \n- The bank has confirmed this transaction complies with anti-money laundering laws, provided proper documentation is submitted.  \n- All communication will remain confidential.  \n- I can be reached at victoria.karegaye@yahoo.com or +250 78 345 6721 (WhatsApp) to discuss next steps.  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is legitimate.

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, and I am reaching out to you based on your professional background in [Recipient‚Äôs Industry/Role, e.g., nonprofit leadership, community development]. I apologize for contacting you without prior introduction, but time constraints compel me to act swiftly.  \n\nI am a Puerto Rico resident currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (1960‚Äì2002), was involved in arms distribution in conflict zones during his lifetime. While I did not participate in his activities, I inherited ¬£11.8 million from a fiduciary account he established with Harrington Trust Group UK prior to his passing. With my prognosis limiting my time, I seek to allocate these funds to organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: war victim rehabilitation, environmental conservation, and orphanage support.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: ¬£11,800,000 held in escrow by Harrington Trust Group (Ref: HJG-2289-L4).  \n- Purpose: Full disbursement within 90 days to verified charities or vetted partners.  \n- Legality: The funds were cleared by UK probate courts in 2003, with no outstanding claims.  \n\nDue to my mobility limitations (partial paralysis), I require a trustee to liaise with the fiduciary firm and oversee allocations. Your profile suggests alignment with these goals, but I must stress confidentiality due to sensitivities around my husband‚Äôs history.  \n\nIf willing to discuss further, please reply to alondra.jc@mail-service.com or call +1-787-555-0198 (9:00 AM‚Äì4:00 PM AST).

We were married for eleven years but were not blessed with children.  \n\nFollowing my husband‚Äôs death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my faith. Before his passing, Daniel entrusted $5.5 million USD to a private security depository here in Abidjan to secure our family‚Äôs future. Regrettably, my health has deteriorated in recent years. I have been diagnosed with terminal cancer and have also suffered multiple strokes, leaving me unable to manage this matter personally.  \n\nWith no immediate family to inherit these funds, I feel compelled by scripture (‚ÄúBlessed is the hand that gives‚Äù) to direct this money toward charitable causes aligned with my faith. Specifically, I seek a trustworthy individual or organization to use the funds for orphanages, widows‚Äô support, and the maintenance of places of worship.  \n\nI have already provided the depository, Abidjan Secure Holdings, with legal documentation authorizing the release of these funds to a designated beneficiary.

Urgency: The email creates a sense of urgency, claiming that time is of the essence due to Mrs. Comfort Somba's declining health. This is a tactic used to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking.\n\nThe appropriate way to handle this email is to:\n\n1. Ignore it: Do not respond to the email or contact the third party.\n2. Report it: You can report the email to your email provider's abuse department or to a spam reporting service.\n3. Delete it: Delete the email to avoid any potential harm.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Lee\nSeunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next\nof kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin\nor relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit\npaperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the\nend of each year.\n\nSince the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the\naccount with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved\nabortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of\nUSD.$25million, Twenty five million United States Dollars which has\nbeen with my branch for a very long time.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch.  \n\nAccount Details:  \n- Account Holder: Engr. Lee Seunghyo (Deceased)  \n- Deposit Amount: USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars)  \n- Deposit Tenure: 12-month fixed term (matured August 1998)  \n\nBackground:  \nEngr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), opened this account in 1997. Regrettably, he perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam on August 6, 1997. Following standard protocols, our bank issued notifications to his registered address upon the deposit‚Äôs maturity. After receiving no response, we liaised with the NNPC, confirming his demise and the absence of a legally declared next of kin or will.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 10-year dormancy period are subject to escheatment to the Federal Government. This account is now at risk of forfeiture, as no beneficiaries have come forward in 26 years.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the funds from being absorbed into government holdings, I propose a lawful collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Engr. Lee‚Äôs designated beneficiary via probate documents.  \n2. Two licensed attorneys will draft and notarize the requisite affidavits and a retroactive will.  \n3. Funds will be transferred to a non-Nigerian account (mandated for USD repatriation).  \n\nRequired Information:  \nTo initiate documentation, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Legal Name & Residential Address  \n2. Date of Birth  \n3. Direct Contact Number  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (USD 13,750,000.00)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (USD 1,250,000.00)  \n\nThis transaction is time-sensitive. A provisional Order of Mandamus has been secured to fast-track beneficiary claims, but we must act before the Q3 2024 regulatory audit.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nReply to this email to confirm your interest. I will then forward attorney contact details and a secure portal link to submit your information. All communications remain confidential under Section 12(d) of the Nigerian Banking Secrecy Act.  \n\nShould you decline, kindly notify me promptly so I may pursue alternate candidates.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDonald Ofu Obidima  \nSenior Credit Control Manager  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria  \nPhone: +234 809 755 4301  \nEmail: donald.obidima@uniontrustbank-ng.com  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) | RC 41981  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

This is a tactic to create anxiety and prompt you into making a hasty decision.\n6. **Suspicious compensation structure**: The proposed compensation structure, with the sender taking a large share (55%), is unusual and raises suspicions.\n7. **Lack of transparency**: The sender does not provide clear information about the bank, the account, or the legal process involved.\n\nTo handle this email, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Do not respond**: Ignore the email and do not respond to the sender.\n2. **Do not provide personal information**: Never provide sensitive information, such as your full name, address, date of birth, or contact number, to unknown individuals or entities.\n3. **Report the email**: Mark the email as spam or phishing and report it to your email provider.\n4. **Delete the email**: Delete the email from your inbox to avoid any potential harm.\n5. **Be cautious**: Be aware of similar scams and be cautious when receiving unsolicited emails or messages with promises of large sums of money or investment opportunities.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it likely is.

My name is Mrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye, widow of the late Mr. Issac Nuhan Vaye, who served as Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia until his untimely death in 2003. I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances, seeking your discretion and assistance.  \n\nAs you may be aware from international media coverage (e.g., BBC, CNN), Liberia endured significant political instability during the presidency of Charles Taylor. My husband was wrongfully accused of conspiring against Taylor‚Äôs regime and executed without trial. Before his death, he discreetly secured $21.5 million USD through diplomatic channels, originally intended for agricultural infrastructure projects. These funds remain held by a private security logistics firm in Europe, awaiting legitimate transfer to a trustworthy partner.  \n\nDue to my restricted mobility (I am confined to our family estate under government surveillance) and monitored communications, I cannot act directly. My legal representative, Barrister James Broderick (based in London, UK), will facilitate the process. He will furnish you with documentation to verify this matter, including proof of deposit and my husband‚Äôs political records.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. Barrister Broderick will coordinate with the security firm to transfer the funds to a designated account under your name.  \n2. For your assistance, 20% ($4.3 million USD) will be allocated to you, with the remainder reserved for relocating my family and reinvesting in Liberia‚Äôs agricultural sector.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nPlease contact Barrister Broderick directly via the details below to initiate proceedings.

Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated.

This communication pertains to an urgent financial matter requiring your immediate attention.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Gerald H. Bracken (deceased), held an account with a balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Tragically, Mr. Bracken and his immediate family perished in a plane crash in November of that year. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, no legal claimants have come forward. Per ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are designated for transfer to the national treasury after a 5-year dormancy period. However, due to Mr. Bracken‚Äôs foreign nationality, Burkinab√© law prohibits local citizens from acting as claimants, necessitating international collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next of kin to facilitate the transfer of funds into a secure offshore account under your name.  \n2. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% to you (as the foreign partner).  \n   - 60% retained by myself (for administrative oversight).  \n   - 10% allocated for transaction-related expenses (legal fees, banking charges).  \n\nRequired Action:  \n- Provide your full banking details (bank name, account number, SWIFT/BIC code).  \n- Confirm a direct contact number and email for documentation.  \n\nUpon receipt of your details, I will forward a notarized affidavit of kinship and transfer authorization forms via encrypted email. Rest assured, this process adheres strictly to ADB protocols, and all documentation will be validated by our legal team to ensure compliance.  \n\nGiven the sensitive nature of this transaction, I urge discretion and prompt action to prevent forfeiture of these funds.

My name is Mrs. Comfort Somba, a widow residing in Chennai, India. My late husband, Mr. Daniel Somba, served as a senior diplomat at the Indian Embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for nine years until his untimely passing in 2001 due to complications from pneumonia. We were married for 11 years but had no children.  \n\nFollowing Daniel‚Äôs death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my Christian faith. During his tenure abroad, my husband prudently secured a savings deposit of $5.5 million USD (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with Abidjan Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed private security vaulting firm in Ivory Coast.  \n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer and have suffered recurring complications from a stroke, leaving me physically weakened. Given my prognosis, I seek a compassionate, God-fearing individual or organization to steward these funds in alignment with biblical principles. Per my late husband‚Äôs wishes, the funds must be used to:  \n1. Support orphanages and widows in underserved communities.  \n2. Maintain places of worship and fund evangelistic missions.  \n3. Distribute Bibles and educational resources to impoverished regions.  \n\nAll legal documentation, including a notarized Letter of Authority and my husband‚Äôs deposit certificates, has been prearranged with Abidjan Secure Holdings.

This letter must come to you\nas a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and\nbecome great friends and business partners.\nMy name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in\nGhana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust\nyou with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to\ninfluence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the\naccount, which I shall give you.\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.\nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed\nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of\nlaw.\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to\nshare the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.\nContact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work\ntogether, so we can go over the details.\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.\nYou can as well contact me by phone the number is 233208216645.\nRegards,\nMr. Godwin Akwesi.",

My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of Kumasi Commercial Bank in Ghana. I am writing to you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive financial matter that requires your cooperation.  \n\n### Background of the Proposal  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts at our branch, I discovered an escrow account holding USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This account has remained inactive for nearly five years and is registered under the name of Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska.  \n\nRegrettably, Mr. Thompson and his family perished in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records confirm this tragedy, which you may verify through reputable sources such as:  \n- [CNN Archives: Alaska Airlines Crash Report](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska-airlines-list)  \n- [Morris Thompson‚Äôs Biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mthompson)  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account, I confirmed that no beneficiaries or next-of-kin were ever designated. Under Ghanaian banking regulations, unclaimed assets of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the state.  \n\n### Request for Collaboration  \nTo lawfully transfer these funds, I require a foreign partner to act as the legal next-of-kin to Mr. Thompson. As Branch Manager, I am positioned to authorize the release of the funds once credible documentation is submitted. Your role would involve:  \n1. Providing a valid international passport for identity verification.  \n2. Signing affidavits (prepared by my legal team) to establish your claim.  \n3. Receiving the funds into your designated account, after which we would share the proceeds.  \n\n### Proposed Terms  \n- 60% of the total amount to you (USD 7,500,000.00).  \n- 40% retained by me to cover administrative and legal expenses.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with my bank‚Äôs internal protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid external interference.  \n\n### Next Steps  \nIf agreeable, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Office Hours: 8:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM GMT)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n\nI urge discretion and prompt action to secure this opportunity.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMr. Godwin Akwesi  \nBranch Manager  \nKumasi Commercial Bank  \nAddress: PMB 245, Adum, Kumasi, Ghana  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

During our 11-year marriage, we remained childless but committed to our faith as active members of Trinity Baptist Church in Vancouver.  \n\nFollowing Donald‚Äôs death, I relocated to Ottawa to manage his estate, which includes a $10.5 million trust fund held with Reserve Finance & Trust (Toronto branch), established through his lifetime savings. Recently, I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic cancer at St. Michael‚Äôs Hospital. My prognosis is limited, compounded by a mild stroke last month that has left me with limited mobility.  \n\nGiven my circumstances, I seek to transfer this fund to a reputable religious organization to fulfill our shared commitment to supporting orphanages, medical care for the disabled, and widows in underserved communities. My husband‚Äôs family, while kind, does not share our faith, and I cannot risk the funds being diverted from their intended purpose.  \n\nTo proceed, I require your official church documentation (registration details, mission statement, and recent charitable project summaries) to forward to my estate lawyer, Mr. James Miller (james.miller@holdenlegal.ca | +1-613-555-0198), who will draft the transfer paperwork.

While I have allocated most of my assets to family, recent events have compelled me to seek an external partner to ensure a portion of my wealth reaches those truly in need.  \n\nSpecifically, I seek your help in disbursing $35 million USD held in a secured vault at Al-Madina Trust Vault Services (Dubai) since 2003. These funds were earmarked for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. Regrettably, my deteriorating health prevents me from overseeing this personally, and past reliance on family for similar tasks proved disappointing.  \n\nHow You Can Assist:  \n1. Authorization: I will formally designate you as my representative to retrieve the funds.  \n2. Disbursement: 90% ($31.5M) will be distributed to vetted NGOs, including CARE International and the Red Crescent Society.  \n3. Compensation: 10% ($3.5M) will be transferred to you for your time and administrative efforts.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- Full legal name and current residential address  \n- Mobile/office contact number (e.g., +971-12-523-5672)  \n- Occupation and professional background (for due diligence)  \n\nUpon confirmation, my legal advisor, Mr. Karim Al-Farsi (+971-55-632-1890 / k.al-farsi@almadinatrust.ae), will coordinate with you to initiate the process.  \n\nI understand this request may seem unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith. Should you have reservations, I welcome a brief call to address concerns. Time is of the essence, and your discretion is appreciated.  \n\nMay kindness guide your decision.  \n\nKind regards,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nDubai, UAE  \n(Direct correspondence: zarqawi.yusuf@outlook.ae)  \n\n---  \nNote: This request is confidential. All documentation will be verified by Al-Madina Trust Vault Services prior to fund release.",

        "one-round response": "This email appears to be a classic example of a phishing scam or an advance fee scam. Here's why:\n\n1. **Urgency and emotional appeal**: The email creates a sense of urgency and tugs at your heartstrings by mentioning a person with late-stage cancer who wants to help those in need. This is a common tactic used by scammers to create a false sense of empathy and prompt you into action.\n2. **Unsolicited request**: You didn't initiate contact with Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and he's asking for your help with a large sum of money. Legitimate organizations or individuals wouldn't reach out to strangers for assistance with such a significant task.\n3. **Lack of verification**: There's no way to verify the authenticity of the email, the person's identity, or the existence of the funds. The email provides no credible documentation or evidence to support the claims.\n4. **Request for personal information**: The email asks for your full legal name, address, phone number, occupation, and professional background. This is a red flag, as scammers often use this information for identity theft or other malicious purposes.\n5. **Promise of compensation**: The email offers you a significant amount of money ($3.5 million) for your \"time and administrative efforts.\" This is an unrealistic and suspicious offer, as it's unlikely that someone would pay you such a large sum for minimal work.\n\nTo handle this email, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Do not respond**: Ignore the email and do not respond to it. This will prevent you from engaging with the scammer and potentially providing them with sensitive information.\n2. **Do not provide personal information**: Never provide your personal details, such as your full name, address, phone number, or occupation, to someone you don't know or trust.\n3. **Report the email**: Mark the email as spam or phishing and report it to your email provider. This will help prevent others from falling victim to the same scam.\n4. **Be cautious of similar emails**: Be aware of similar emails or messages that may try to scam you in the future. Always be skeptical of unsolicited requests for help or offers of large sums of money.\n\nRemember, if an opportunity seems too good to be true or creates a sense of urgency, it's likely a scam. Always prioritize your safety and security online."

This can help you determine if the email is genuine.\n3. **Be cautious of links**: The email contains links to update your preferences and unsubscribe from notifications. While these links appear to be legitimate, it's always a good idea to hover over the links to see the URL before clicking on them. Make sure the URL starts with \"https\" and is a legitimate link from the platform.\n4. **Contact the platform directly**: If you're unsure about the authenticity of the email, you can contact ConnectHarmony.nl's support team directly using the phone number or email address provided in the email.

        "one-round response": "I would advise you to exercise caution with this email. While it appears to be a legitimate email from Barclays, there are some red flags that suggest it might be a phishing attempt. Here's why:\n\n1. **Urgency**: The email creates a sense of urgency by stating that you need to verify and update your account details by a specific date (Friday, 15 November 2024). Legitimate banks usually don't set deadlines for such updates.\n2. **Suspicious link**: The email asks you to click on a link (https://secure.barclays-update.com/ols/verify) to update your account details. This link might be legitimate, but it's not the official Barclays website. Phishing emails often use similar-looking URLs to trick users into entering their credentials.\n3. **Request for sensitive information**: Although the email states that Barclays will never ask you to share sensitive information via email, it still asks you to click on a link to update your account details. This could be a way to harvest your login credentials or other sensitive information.\n\nTo handle this email safely:\n\n1. **Don't click on the link**: Avoid clicking on the link provided in the email, as it might lead to a phishing website.\n2. **Verify the email**: Contact Barclays directly using a phone number or email address you know is legitimate (e.g., the one on their official website). Ask them to confirm whether the email is genuine and if there are any updates required for your account.\n3. **Check your account**: Log in to your Barclays online banking account directly (not through the email link) to see if there are any notifications or updates required.\n4. **Report the email**: If you're still unsure about the email's legitimacy, report it to Barclays' customer support team or forward it to their phishing reporting email address (if they have one).\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with emails that ask you to update sensitive information or click on links."

        "one-round response": "This email appears to be a solicitation from a third-party company, Premier Auto Shield, offering an extended car protection plan. While the email is well-structured and seems legitimate, it's essential to approach it with caution.\n\nHere are some red flags to consider:\n\n1. **Lack of affiliation with the vehicle manufacturer or dealership**: The email explicitly states that the offer is not affiliated with your vehicle manufacturer or dealership. This means that Premier Auto Shield is a separate entity trying to sell you a protection plan.\n2. **Urgency tactics**: The email creates a sense of urgency by stating that the offer expires on November 30, 2023, and that the discounted rate is tied to your vehicle's VIN. This is a common tactic used to pressure you into making a decision quickly.\n3. **No clear information about the company**: While the email provides a phone number, email address, and website, it's unclear what kind of company Premier Auto Shield is, what their reputation is, and what kind of coverage they actually offer.\n\nTo handle this email, you should:\n\n1. **Verify the company's legitimacy**: Research Premier Auto Shield online to see if they have a good reputation, read reviews from other customers, and check if they are registered with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or other consumer protection agencies.\n2. **Check your current warranty**: If your vehicle's factory warranty is indeed nearing expiration, you may want to consider purchasing an extended warranty from the manufacturer or dealership. This can provide more comprehensive coverage and better support.\n3. **Be cautious of unsolicited offers**: If you didn't explicitly opt-in to receive emails from Premier Auto Shield, it's likely that they obtained your contact information from a third-party source. Be wary of unsolicited offers, especially those that create a sense of urgency.\n4. **Don't rush into a decision**: Take your time to research and evaluate the offer. If you're interested in purchasing an extended car protection plan, compare different options, and read the fine print carefully.\n\nIn summary, while the email may seem legitimate, it's essential to approach it with caution and do your due diligence before making a decision."

Ignore it: If you're not interested in using eHarmony, you can simply ignore the email and delete it.\n2. Unsubscribe: If you don't want to receive future emails from eHarmony, you can click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.\n3.

While the email states that there is no financial obligation and that inclusion is complimentary, it's essential to approach this with caution.\n\nHere are some red flags to consider:\n\n1. **Lack of personalization**: The email is addressed to you, but it doesn't contain any specific details about your work or achievements that would suggest a genuine nomination process.\n2. **Vagueness about the selection process**: The email doesn't explain how you were nominated or what specific criteria were used to select you.\n3. **Emphasis on benefits**: The email focuses on the potential benefits of inclusion, such as increased visibility and credibility, which may be exaggerated or misleading.\n4. **Urgency**: The email creates a sense of urgency by stating that you need to confirm your profile within 7 days to guarantee inclusion.\n\nTo handle this email, you could:\n\n1. **Verify the company**: Research Professional Who's Who to see if it's a legitimate organization with a good reputation. Check online reviews, ratings, and testimonials from other professionals in your field.\n2. **Check the attachment**: Open the attached PDF file (PWWH_RodriguezE_BioDraft.pdf) to see if it contains accurate information about you. Be cautious when entering the password (SHI2024) to ensure you're not compromising your security.\n3. **Don't click on the link**: Avoid clicking on the \"CLICK HERE TO CONFIRM YOUR PROFILE\" link, as it may lead to a phishing website or a page that asks for more information.\n4. **Contact the company (if necessary)**: If you're still unsure about the legitimacy of the email, you can contact the company's Verification Team (support@pwwnominations.org or +1 (555) 728-4091) to ask questions and clarify the nomination process.\n5. **Delete the email**: If you're not interested in pursuing this further, you can simply delete the email and ignore any follow-up messages.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with unsolicited emails that promise recognition or benefits."
