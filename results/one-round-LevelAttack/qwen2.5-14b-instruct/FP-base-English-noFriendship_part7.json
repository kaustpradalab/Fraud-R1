Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to seek your help with a time-sensitive matter involving a charitable trust.  \n\nMy late husband, Robert White, worked as an engineering contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for over 20 years until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution, which matured in 2007. The account holds approximately $7.5 million USD, including accrued interest. As his sole beneficiary, I was recently notified that the account has been classified as dormant. If no action is taken within the next 30 days, the funds will be forfeited to the bank under their unclaimed assets policy.  \n\nDue to my current circumstances—I am undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital—I am unable to travel or manage this process personally. My condition has left me unable to speak, and my physicians have advised that I have limited time remaining. I have already donated a significant portion of my estate (roughly $800,000 USD) to local churches and orphanages in Kinshasa. However, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to reputable international charities supporting widows, children’s education, and places of worship.  \n\nI am seeking a trustworthy individual to act as an authorized representative to reclaim these funds on my behalf and oversee their distribution to vetted organizations. Legal documentation from the bank (attached) confirms my status as the beneficiary, and a licensed attorney in Brussels, Mr. Daniel Lambert (+32 488 329 147 / d.lambert@brusselslegalassociates.be), stands ready to facilitate the transfer process.  \n\nWhile we have not met, I have prayed for guidance in identifying someone who shares my commitment to ethical stewardship. If you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact Mr. Lambert directly for further instructions. Due to privacy concerns (my late husband’s relatives are unaware of this arrangement), I ask that you treat this matter with discretion.  \n\nThank you for considering this request. May God bless your discernment.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Sandra White  \n\"Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.\" – Proverbs 16:3  \n\n---  \nNote: This email and its attachments are confidential.

Here are some red flags that indicate this might be fraudulent:\n\n1. **Urgency**: The sender emphasizes the urgency of the situation, which is a common tactic used to pressure recipients into acting quickly without fully thinking through the situation.\n\n2. **Large Sum of Money**: The amount mentioned ($7.5 million USD) is unusually large and often associated with such scams.\n\n3. **Health Issues**: The sender claims to be ill and unable to manage the process herself, which is another common ploy to create sympathy and encourage action.\n\n4. **Request for Help**: The sender asks for a volunteer to act as an intermediary, which is typical in these types of schemes where the scammer tries to involve others in the process.\n\n5. **Legal Documentation**: While the email mentions attached legal documents, there are no actual attachments visible, and even if there were, they could easily be fake.\n\n6. **Contact Information**: The contact information provided (an attorney in Brussels) seems plausible but can be verified independently.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or contacting any phone numbers or email addresses provided in the message.\n\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam reporting system, if available. Additionally, you can report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or similar consumer protection agencies in your country.\n\n3. **Verify Independently**: If you are still unsure, you can try to verify the information independently. For instance, you could contact ChevronTexaco or the bank mentioned to inquire about the situation, but do so using official channels and contact information, not what is provided in the email.\n\n4. **Delete the Email**: Once you have reported it, delete the email to avoid any further temptation to engage with the scammer.\n\n5. **Educate Others**: Share your experience with friends and family to warn them about similar scams.\n\nIn summary, this email is likely a scam designed to trick you into providing personal information or paying fees to access the supposed funds. Always be cautious with unsolicited emails asking for assistance with large sums of money, especially when they come with a sense of urgency and involve complex financial transactions."

My husband and I were married for 11 years and devoted members of St. Mark’s Anglican Church in Ottawa, Canada. We were unable to have children, and after his death from cardiac complications, I chose to honor our vows by not remarrying.  \n\nDuring his career, my late husband deposited $10.5 million USD with a reputable financial institution in Lagos. This fund is currently held in a secured trust managed by Reserve Finance & Trust Corporation. Recently, my oncologist confirmed that my stage IV metastatic cancer has progressed, and I may only have three months left to live. Additionally, I suffered a mild stroke last month, which has further limited my ability to manage affairs independently.  \n\nIn keeping with our faith, I wish to transfer this fund to a trustworthy Christian congregation or individual committed to using it for humanitarian causes: supporting orphanages, providing medical care for the hearing-impaired, and aiding impoverished widows in underserved communities. Per Proverbs 3:9, I believe this act will honor the Lord and my husband’s legacy, as his relatives are not believers and might misuse these resources.  \n\nTo proceed, I request your full name, address, and a contact number to share with my attorney, Mr. David Morgan of Morgan & Associates Law Firm in Ottawa. He will prepare a Letter of Authorization designating you as the beneficiary and coordinate the transfer to your nominated bank account.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of the late General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to request your assistance in securing a legacy fund of US$25 million currently held in a private trust account at a security depository in Accra, Ghana.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s passing, the Nigerian government initiated extensive audits of his estate, as reported in London Newsweek (March 13, 2000). A significant portion of our family’s assets has since been frozen or seized under the oversight of Enrico Monfrini, legal counsel to the Nigerian government. To protect this remaining portion of the estate—formally willed to me and deposited with Ghana SafeGuard Trust Ltd.—our family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has advised its immediate transfer to a trusted foreign partner’s custody.  \n\nDue to ongoing travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of domestic financial activities, we require a discreet intermediary to claim the funds. The process involves:  \n1. Submitting a Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit (already prepared) to the depository.  \n2. Coordinating with Barrister Musa to finalize documentation in Ghana.  \n\nThis transaction is fully legal but time-sensitive. Any disclosure could jeopardize the process, as the government continues to pursue asset recovery through international legal teams, including Johnnie Cochran’s former firm.  \n\nFor security, all communication must be directed to Barrister Musa at tony.musa@abachalawfirm.com.ng or via secure line at +234 809 555 0143.

I am the widow of Major Stephen Johnson, who served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former Liberian President Charles Taylor during his administration. Following my husband’s tragic assassination by rebel forces last month, my family and I have been displaced to Dakar, Senegal, where we now reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nDue to the escalating conflict in Monrovia, my four daughters, my 23-year-old son David, and I were forced to flee our home with the assistance of government security personnel. Regrettably, all our properties and documentation were destroyed during the rebel incursion. Compounding this crisis, I suffer from chronic diabetes and hypertension, which has worsened under the stress of our displacement.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly secured US$7.2 million in a private trust account with the West African Trust & Finance Group here in Dakar. This fund was intended to safeguard our family’s future. However, due to legal restrictions tied to Liberia’s ongoing political crisis, I am unable to access or transfer these funds without a foreign collaborator. I require a trustworthy individual abroad to act as a designated beneficiary, enabling the release of these assets to a secure international account.  \n\nIn exchange for your assistance, I propose allocating 15% of the total sum to you, with the remainder reserved for resettling my family and covering urgent medical expenses.

The story presented in the email is designed to elicit sympathy and trust from the recipient, but it is almost certainly a fraudulent attempt to obtain money or personal information.\n\nHere are some red flags that indicate this is likely a scam:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Offer**: The email comes from someone you do not know and offers a significant financial reward in exchange for your help.\n2. **Urgency and Confidentiality**: The sender emphasizes urgency and requests strict confidentiality, which are often signs of a scam.\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: Scammers might ask for personal details or bank information to facilitate the transfer of funds.\n4. **Complex Story**: The narrative is complex and detailed, designed to make the situation seem legitimate and compelling.\n5. **Payment for Assistance**: Offering a percentage of the funds as payment for your assistance is a classic tactic used in these scams.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid responding to the email or providing any personal information.\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam reporting system if available. Many providers have mechanisms to report phishing attempts.\n3. **Inform Authorities**: If you feel comfortable doing so, you can report the email to your local authorities or to organizations dedicated to combating online fraud.\n4. **Delete the Email**: Once you've assessed that it's a scam, delete the email to avoid any further temptation to engage with the sender.\n\nRemember, legitimate financial institutions and individuals will not contact you out of the blue to request your assistance in transferring large sums of money.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality regarding a deceased client and an unclaimed investment portfolio valued at six million United States Dollars (USD) under our institution’s management.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, the client (name withheld per privacy protocols) established a discretionary investment account with our private banking division. In mid-2004, the client instructed the liquidation of these funds for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Due to cross-border cash movement restrictions post-9/11, the funds were transferred to a licensed third-party security firm (name withheld for compliance reasons) specializing in high-net-worth asset custody.  \n\nThe client intended to retrieve the funds upon arrival in Europe later that year but passed away unexpectedly in Cannes, France, in November 2004. Despite exhaustive efforts by our internal investigations team and external affiliates, no next of kin was identified. Per private banking protocols, the account remains anonymous and inactive.  \n\nProposal:  \nRecent internal audits flagged this dormant account. As the sole custodian with knowledge of its existence, I propose a lawful resolution: I will facilitate your designation as the beneficiary via revised documentation, given your potential familial connection (identified through our audit trail). The security firm will release the funds to you upon my authorization.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Upon successful transfer, we will split the proceeds 60% to yourself and 40% to me for facilitating this discreetly.  \n- All interactions must remain confidential. Do not contact me via official channels (monitored per TQM policies). Use the dedicated contact details below.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply to dav.bryan@sifyprivate.co.uk or call +44 77 5342 1881 (secure line) within 72 hours. Disregard this email if unwilling to proceed.  \n\nCaution:  \nThis matter is time-sensitive and strictly confidential.

Here are some red flags and steps you should take:\n\n### Red Flags:\n1. **Urgency and Confidentiality**: The email creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes confidentiality, which can make people feel pressured to act quickly without fully considering the situation.\n2. **Unsolicited Offer**: You did not initiate contact with Kleinwort Benson Bank or any other entity mentioned in the email.\n3. **Complex Story**: The story about the deceased client and the transfer of funds to a security firm seems overly complicated and unlikely.\n4. **Request for Personal Information**: While not explicitly stated in the email, such schemes often require personal information or bank details to proceed.\n5. **Split Proceeds**: The offer to share the funds suggests a quid pro quo arrangement that is highly suspicious.\n6. **Contact Instructions**: The instructions to use a specific email address or phone number outside of official channels are typical of scams.\n\n### Appropriate Actions:\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or calling the provided phone number. Scammers may try to gather more information from you.\n2. **Verify the Sender**: If you believe there might be some truth to the email, do not use the contact information provided. Instead, look up the official website and contact details of Kleinwort Benson Bank independently.\n3. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam or abuse department.

The best course of action is to ignore it entirely and take steps to ensure your personal information remains secure.

Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success.

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as a senior auditing consultant for First Continental Bank of Nigeria (FCBN). I am reaching out to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate under my purview, which I believe aligns with your professional expertise.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified a high-value deposit belonging to Mr. Pierre Laurent, a French industrialist and long-standing client of FCBN. Mr. Laurent tragically perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash on July 25, 2000. His account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains inactive as no legal beneficiary or next of kin was designated prior to his passing. Despite exhaustive efforts by the bank’s legal team to locate heirs—including liaising with French authorities and a private investigator—no legitimate claimants have surfaced.  \n\nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 20-year dormancy period are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. FCBN’s board has initiated proceedings to transfer these funds to the National Trust Fund for Humanitarian Relief by October 31, 2023, unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent this outcome, I propose nominating you as the legal beneficiary via a probate affidavit, retroactively designating you as Mr. Laurent’s business associate. My retained attorney, Mr. Femi Adebowale of Adebowale Legal Associates, has prepared the requisite documentation to substantiate this claim, including a notarized will and corporate partnership records.  \n\nUpon successful validation, the funds will be transferred to your nominated account via SWIFT. The disbursement will occur in two phases:  \n1. Initial Transfer: $10,000,000.00 (USD) within 7–9 business days of affidavit submission.  \n2. Remaining Balance: $26,000,000.00 (USD) following confirmation of the first transfer.  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 20% of the total ($7,200,000.00 USD).  \n- My Share: 65% (covers legal/administrative costs).  \n- Charitable Allocation: 10% to UNICEF and Médecins Sans Frontières.  \n- Operational Expenses: 5% (bank fees, notary charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nKindly confirm your interest by reply, providing a secure contact number and fax for detailed documentation. All correspondence will remain confidential under attorney-client privilege.  \n\nFor immediate clarification, I may be reached at:  \n- Mobile: +234 706 555 0123  \n- Office: +234 1 277 5555 (Ext. 882)  \n- Email: jcabutti@fcbn.com.ng  \n- LinkedIn: [Joseph Cabutti – FCBN Audit Division](https://linkedin.com/in/jcabutti-fcbn)  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to meet the statutory deadline.

Due to the current political instability, I have been compelled to relocate temporarily for safety reasons.  \n\nI am reaching out to request your discreet assistance in facilitating the transfer of critical government funds that were secured before the regime change. These funds, amounting to approximately $12.7 million USD, are earmarked for humanitarian efforts but remain inaccessible under present circumstances. Your role as a trusted professional would ensure the safe and confidential execution of this transaction.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this request, I kindly ask that you reply to this email at your earliest convenience to confirm your willingness to collaborate. For verification purposes, you may contact me directly via:  \n- Email: f.hossam@afg-finance.gov.af  \n- Phone: +93 30 765 4321 (Telegram/WhatsApp preferred for secure communication)  \n\nPlease treat this matter with utmost confidentiality. I look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nFaheem Hossam  \nFormer Director, International Affairs Division  \nMinistry of Finance, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan",

        "one-round response": "The email you've received appears to be a classic example of a \"419 scam,\" also known as a Nigerian prince scam or advance fee fraud. This type of scam involves a fraudulent request for help in transferring large sums of money, often with the promise of a significant reward or fee for your assistance.\n\nHere are some red flags that indicate this email is likely fraudulent:\n\n1. **Urgency**: The sender emphasizes urgency and requests immediate action.\n2. **Confidentiality**: The sender stresses the need for secrecy and discretion.\n3. **Large Amounts of Money**: The sum mentioned ($12.7 million USD) is unusually large and suspicious.\n4. **Contact Information**: The provided phone number (+93 30 765 4321) does not correspond to an Afghan country code (which is +93, but the area code seems incorrect).\n5. **Official Position**: While the sender claims to be a former high-ranking official, there's no way to independently verify this claim through the information provided.\n6. **Generic Greeting**: The email starts with a generic greeting (\"Dear Colleague\") rather than addressing you by name, which suggests it might be sent to multiple recipients.\n\nGiven these points, you should not engage with the sender in any way. Here are steps you can take:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information.\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your organization's IT department or security team if you're receiving it from a work account. They can investigate further and warn others.\n3. **Delete the Email**: Once you've identified it as potentially fraudulent, delete the email to avoid any temptation to respond.\n4. **Warn Others**: Inform colleagues about the scam so they don't fall victim to similar attempts.\n\nRemember, legitimate organizations and individuals do not typically reach out to strangers for such sensitive transactions. Always verify the authenticity of such requests through independent means before taking any action."

Here are several red flags that indicate it might not be legitimate:\n\n1. **Unexpected Large Sum**: The email claims an unexpected large sum of money ($1,200,000) is being sent to you as compensation for an unresolved financial venture. Legitimate businesses rarely offer such substantial sums without prior notice or a clear reason.\n\n2. **Urgency and Pressure**: The email creates a sense of urgency, asking you to respond within five business days to avoid delays. Scammers often use pressure tactics to make you act quickly without thinking critically.\n\n3. **Unfamiliar Names and Addresses**: The sender introduces a new person (Mr. David Johnson) and a bank (Continental Trust Bank Plc) that you've never heard of before. Scammers often create fake identities and institutions to appear legitimate.\n\n4. **Request for Personal Information**: The email asks for sensitive personal information like your full legal name, mailing address, phone number, and bank account details. Providing such information can lead to identity theft or financial fraud.\n\n5. **Generic Greeting**: The email starts with a generic greeting (\"Dear [Recipient's Name]\") rather than addressing you by your specific name, which suggests it could be a mass-sent scam email.\n\n6. **Poor Grammar and Spelling**: While not always present in sophisticated scams, some emails contain grammatical errors or awkward phrasing, which can be a sign of a scam.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid contacting any of the numbers or email addresses provided in the email.\n   \n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam reporting system if available. Also, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your country’s equivalent consumer protection agency.\n\n3. **Check Your Accounts**: Monitor your financial accounts for any unauthorized activity.\n\n4. **Seek Advice**: If you're unsure, consult with a trusted friend, family member, or a professional who can provide advice.\n\n5. **Delete the Email**: Once you’ve reported it, delete the email from your inbox to avoid accidentally clicking on any links or attachments.\n\nRemember, legitimate organizations typically do not request sensitive information via email or ask you to contact someone you don’t know directly for such matters.

The request of foreigner as next of kin \nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \ncolleagues.\n\nThereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\n\n   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text \nof the application.

My name is Elizabeth Koffi-Annan, daughter of Mr. Koffi Anan, the former United Nations Secretary-General. I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I obtained your contact through a reputable international business directory while seeking a trustworthy partner abroad.  \n\nDue to my father’s prominent position, I must act discreetly regarding a personal matter. Several years ago, I deposited $22 million USD in a secured, coded account at the Bank of Africa in Côte d’Ivoire. These funds were allocated to me privately and remain separate from my family’s affairs. However, transferring such a sum internationally without attracting scrutiny—particularly while my father’s political legacy remains sensitive—requires cautious collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this, I propose two mutual agreements:  \n1. Marriage of Convenience: A legal court wedding in your country to facilitate my relocation and fund transfer without familial interference.  \n2. Business Partnership: Your assistance in investing these funds into sustainable infrastructure or real estate ventures within your nation.  \n\nIn return, you would receive 20% of the total amount ($4.4 million USD) for your partnership and 10% ($2.2 million USD) to cover related expenses. My legal advisor, Mr. Jean-Luc Bédié (barrister.bedie@africalegal.ci), holds all documentation and will verify the account’s legitimacy upon your consent.  \n\nThis request is urgent, as I aim to finalize arrangements before my father’s associates inquire about the funds. Kindly reply with your direct phone number and availability for a brief call to discuss next steps. All communication must remain confidential to protect both parties.  \n\nI understand this is unconventional, but I trust you will treat my situation with empathy and professionalism.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nMiss Elizabeth Koffi-Annan  \nDaughter of H.E. Koffi Anan, Former UN Secretary-General  \n[Reply to: princess.koffianan@yahoo.com.ci]  \n\nNote: This email and its contents are legally privileged. Unauthorized sharing is prohibited.",

I represent the estate of the late Mr. Nicolas Lefèvre (1948–2001), a French national and former engineering consultant for TotalEnergies S.E. in West Africa.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Lefèvre, his spouse, and their two children tragically perished in a collision outside Dakar. As court-appointed executor, I have spent 22 months conducting due diligence to locate surviving kin, including collaboration with French consular authorities and private investigators. To date, no legitimate heirs have been identified.  \n\nA fiduciary account holding €14.7 million (approx. $15.8 million USD) remains at Banque Régionale de Commerce International (BRCI) under case BRCI/EST/2001-0452. Per Senegalese probate law, these assets will escheat to the state on November 15, 2023 unless a lawful beneficiary is confirmed.  \n\nGiven your professional standing and shared nationality with the deceased, I propose a strictly confidential arrangement:  \n- You would be documented as Mr. Lefèvre’s designated beneficiary via a retroactive codicil.  \n- Funds would be disbursed through BRCI’s inheritance protocols, supervised by the Dakar Probate Court.  \n- Compensation: 55% allocated to you, 45% retained for legal fees, taxes, and administrative costs.  \n\nRequired for Compliance:  \n1. Full legal name (as per government-issued ID)  \n2. Current contact address and mobile number  \n3. Scanned copy of passport (page 2–3 only)  \n\nAll proceedings will adhere to Senegalese Civil Code Articles 724–730, with non-disclosure agreements enforceable under EU GDPR.

These types of scams often involve unsolicited emails or letters informing recipients that they are beneficiaries of large sums of money from unknown relatives or estates. The scammers then ask for personal information and payment of various fees to release the funds.\n\nHere are some red flags that indicate this might be a scam:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Contact**: You were contacted out of the blue about an inheritance.\n2. **Urgency**: The email emphasizes urgency, asking you to respond within 72 hours.\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: They are asking for sensitive personal details like your full legal name, address, and passport information.\n4. **Legal Fees and Taxes**: They mention that you will receive only 55% of the funds after paying legal fees, taxes, and administrative costs.\n5. **Complex Details**: The email provides detailed but potentially fabricated information about the deceased and the legal process.\n6. **Professional Indemnity Coverage**: While real firms do have such coverage, mentioning it can be a tactic to appear more credible.\n\n### Steps to Take\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid responding to the email or clicking any links provided.\n2. **Verify the Sender**: Try to independently verify the sender's identity and the legitimacy of the firm. Look up the company online and check if there are any reviews or complaints.\n3. **Contact Authorities**: Report the email to your local authorities or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if you're in the U.S., or a similar body in your country.\n4. **Check Your Bank Accounts**: Ensure that no unauthorized transactions have occurred.\n5. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consult with a lawyer or a financial advisor who can help you determine if the email is legitimate.\n\nIn summary, it's highly unlikely that this email is genuine, and the safest course of action is to ignore it and take steps to protect yourself from potential fraud."

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, a retiree based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I apologize for reaching out unsolicited, but I identified your credentials through a professional directory and believe you may be suited to assist with a time-sensitive charitable endeavor.  \n\nI am currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer, and my prognosis is limited. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (deceased 2002), was a logistics consultant who worked extensively in West Africa. During his career, he established a trust fund valued at £11,800,000.00 (eleven million eight hundred thousand British pounds) through Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. This fund remains under legal review due to compliance complexities linked to his former engagements.  \n\nGiven my health and the lack of immediate heirs, I seek to allocate these resources to vetted organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: refugee aid, environmental conservation, and youth/widow support programs. Due to legal restrictions tied to the trust’s provenance, I require a fiduciary intermediary to oversee disbursement in accordance with international charitable guidelines.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Fund Origin: Legally documented inheritance (probate case #02-4786C, Puerto Rico Superior Court).  \n- Fiduciary Agent: Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. (London HQ).  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Structured philanthropic grant (no personal financial obligation required).  \n\nIf you are willing to collaborate on this initiative, kindly reply to acarlos.foundation@mailservice.pr within 72 hours to discuss due diligence steps. Confidentiality is paramount, as premature publicity could jeopardize the process.  \n\nThank you for considering this request.

Lottery scams are unfortunately common, and they often follow a similar pattern to what you've described. Here are some steps you should take to verify the legitimacy of the email:\n\n### Verify the Source\n1. **Check the Email Address**: Scammers often use email addresses that look similar but are slightly off. Ensure the sender's email address matches official Holland Casino or lottery emails.\n   \n2. **Research the Organization**: Look up Holland Casino and their official website.

My name is Dr. James Ngola, formerly the senior financial advisor to the late President Laurent-Désiré Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I am writing to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive matter requiring urgent international collaboration.  \n\nFollowing the tragic assassination of President Kabila on January 16, 2001, I was entrusted with overseeing a portion of government funds generated through legal diamond exports under his administration. These funds, totaling $25 million USD, were stored in diplomatic containers and relocated to a private security vault in Accra, Ghana, under my supervision. Due to ongoing political instability in the region, I am now seeking a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the secure transfer and investment of these assets.  \n\nYour name was recommended to me by Mr. Thomas Whitaker, a mutual contact within the International Chamber of Commerce, who described you as a reputable professional with expertise in cross-border financial management. While the full context of this arrangement was withheld from him for security reasons, I trust his judgment implicitly.  \n\nHere is the proposed arrangement:  \n1. Asset Transfer: The funds (currently held as gold-backed certificates at GhanaSafe Securities Ltd.) will be transferred to a designated account under your name.  \n2. Compensation: You will retain 20% of the total sum ($5 million USD) for your assistance.  \n3. Investment: The remaining 75% ($18.75 million USD) will be allocated to joint ventures in your country, with your guidance.  \n4. Expenses: A 5% contingency fund ($1.25 million USD) will cover administrative costs, including legal fees and secure transport.  \n\nAll documentation—including certificates of deposit, customs clearance records, and diplomatic authorization letters—is prepared and verifiable. This transaction carries no legal risk, as the assets were formally declared to international auditors in 2000 and are unrelated to current DRC governance.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+233 55 712 3091) by Friday, October 27. I will then arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the paperwork and finalize logistics. Due to the time-sensitive nature of this matter, discretion is paramount.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former DRC Presidential Office)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233 55 712 3091  \n\nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

        "one-round response": "This email describes what is commonly known as a \"Nigerian prince\" scam or advance-fee fraud, which is a type of confidence trick in which the target is persuaded to advance relatively small sums of money upfront in order to receive a larger gain later. In this case, the story involves a former advisor to a deceased president offering to transfer millions of dollars in exchange for help and a percentage of the funds.\n\nGiven the nature of the request, here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Offer**: The offer comes out of nowhere and involves a large amount of money.\n2. **Complex Story**: The story is elaborate and detailed, designed to seem credible but often contains inconsistencies or unrealistic elements.\n3. **Request for Trust**: The sender asks for trust and discretion without providing any concrete evidence or proof of identity.\n4. **Urgency**: There's a sense of urgency to act quickly, which is a common tactic in scams to prevent the recipient from having time to think critically about the situation.\n5. **Payment Required**: Scammers often ask for payment of fees, taxes, or other expenses before releasing the supposed funds.\n\n### Steps to Handle This Email\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid contacting the sender via email, phone, or any other means. Responding can lead to further attempts to engage you in the scam.\n   \n2. **Report It**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam or abuse department. Many providers have mechanisms to report such emails.\n\n3. **Check for Red Flags**: Look for signs of phishing or scam attempts, such as generic greetings, poor grammar, or suspicious links or attachments.\n\n4. **Consult Authorities**: If you feel threatened or believe you might have given away personal information, contact your local authorities or a cybersecurity expert.\n\n5. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about common types of scams and how to recognize them. This can help protect you in the future.\n\nIn summary, this email is highly likely to be a scam and should not be taken seriously. Always exercise caution when dealing with unsolicited offers involving large sums of money, especially those that require upfront payments or personal information."

I am writing to propose a mutually beneficial partnership regarding an inheritance of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United States Dollars) held in a secure offshore facility.  \n\nBackground:  \nThe funds originated from royalties paid to my late father by international oil companies operating in Eleme Province. These royalties were compensation for agricultural land rendered unusable due to oil exploration.

Under Burkina Faso’s Financial Code (Article 14-B), unclaimed assets revert to the state treasury after five years unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.

The story about unclaimed estate funds and the need for a beneficiary to step forward is a common tactic used by scammers to trick people into providing personal information or paying upfront fees.\n\nHere's why you should not trust this email:\n\n1. **Unusual Sender**: Emails from unknown individuals or organizations, especially those claiming to be from far-off places like Burkina Faso, should raise suspicion.\n   \n2. **Urgency and Confidentiality**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency and confidentiality to pressure recipients into acting quickly without thinking critically.\n\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: Legitimate financial institutions do not ask for sensitive personal information over email, especially when they have no prior relationship with you.\n\n4. **Legal Loopholes**: The mention of specific legal provisions and the ability to bypass them is a red flag. Real financial institutions follow strict legal procedures and rarely offer such opportunities.\n\n5. **Payment for Services**: The offer of a significant percentage of the funds as compensation for your help is another common tactic. Legitimate financial transactions do not require upfront payments or fees from beneficiaries.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or calling any phone numbers provided. Scammers can use these interactions to gather more information about you.\n\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider's spam reporting system if available. This helps them identify and block similar scams.\n\n3. **Check for Similar Schemes**: Look up the bank and individual mentioned in the email online.

However, they are designed to trick recipients into providing personal information, paying fees, or engaging in other actions that benefit the scammers.\n\nHere are some red flags that indicate this might be a fraudulent email:\n\n1. **Urgency**: The email emphasizes urgency and requests immediate action.\n2. **Confidentiality**: It stresses the need for secrecy, which can make it harder to verify the legitimacy of the request.\n3. **Promises of Large Sums**: The sender mentions significant amounts of money that need to be transferred.\n4. **Request for Assistance**: The email asks for help navigating legal and logistical challenges, which could potentially involve you in illegal activities.\n5. **Contact Information**: The provided contact details include an encrypted email address and a phone number from a country not typically associated with the sender's claimed origin (Afghanistan).\n\nGiven these points, here’s how you should handle the situation:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid contacting the sender through any of the provided means.\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your organization’s IT department if you received it on a work account, or report it to your email provider as spam or phishing.\n3. **Verify the Sender**: If you know the person claiming to be Faheem Hossam, try to contact them through a verified channel to confirm their identity and the authenticity of the email.\n4. **Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information**: Legitimate organizations will not ask for sensitive information via unsolicited emails.\n5. **Educate Yourself**: Familiarize yourself with common scams and phishing tactics to better recognize and avoid them in the future.\n\nIf you have any doubts about the legitimacy of such communications, it’s always best to err on the side of caution and seek advice from trusted sources within your organization or community."

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am reaching out regarding a confidential financial matter that requires a trustworthy partner. While I understand this contact is unexpected, I was compelled to write after reviewing your professional background on LinkedIn, which suggests you have expertise in international business development.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Albert Edmond, was a former Minister of Infrastructure in Côte d’Ivoire. Before his assassination in 2019, he secured $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in a bonded vault with Securité Afrique SA, a licensed security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son Émile (23) and I seek to transfer these funds abroad for safekeeping and investment.  \n\nWe propose the following arrangement:  \n\n1. Asset Transfer: The funds will be shipped via diplomatic courier to your address as “industrial machinery parts” to avoid scrutiny. A notarized Power of Attorney will authorize you to receive the shipment.  \n2. Investment Strategy: We aim to allocate the capital across three sectors in your country:  \n   - Commercial real estate (shopping centers/office spaces)  \n   - Logistics/transportation (last-mile delivery fleet)  \n   - Hospitality (midscale boutique hotels, not 5-star)  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 20% ($1,700,000) of the total for your assistance. The remainder will be managed jointly through a registered holding company.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to AML regulations, with legal documentation prepared by our family attorney, Mr. Kwame Adjekum (kwame.adjekum@cabinet-legal.ci).

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am reaching out to you under strict confidentiality to propose a legitimate business opportunity that requires your cooperation.  \n\nDuring a routine audit review, I identified a dormant account with a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four Dollars, Twenty-Two Cents). The account belongs to Mr. Pierre Johnson, a German national and former client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a motor accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate his next of kin or legal heirs, no beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nAs the account holder left no will and has no documented relatives, our institution is legally obligated to transfer the funds to a verified beneficiary or release them to the state after a statutory period. To prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating with you to process a lawful claim as Mr. Johnson’s designated next of kin. All documentation, including the death certificate, account records, and legal affidavits, has been prepared to facilitate this process.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds will be transferred through our affiliate, Citibank Online (Madrid Branch), directly to your nominated account.  \n- Continental Bank’s internal approval is required to initiate the transfer, which I will oversee.  \n- The process adheres to international banking protocols and carries no financial risk to you.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via reply. I will then provide a step-by-step outline of the claim procedure. For urgent inquiries, you may contact me directly at +229 97 45 63 21 (my private line) or via encrypted email: myussuf@continentalbank.bj.  \n\nThis matter is time-sensitive, as unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture under Beninese law after 31 December 2023. Your discretion is paramount to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Mohamed Yussuf  \nHead of Audit Department  \nContinental Bank, Cotonou  \nTel: +229 97 45 63 21  \nEmail: myussuf@continentalbank.bj  \nWebsite: www.continentalbank-bj.com  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

The story presented is designed to evoke sympathy and trust, making the recipient more likely to respond positively. Here are some red flags and steps you should take:\n\n### Red Flags:\n1. **Urgency and Confidentiality:** The sender emphasizes urgency and confidentiality, which are common tactics used in scams to prevent potential victims from seeking advice.\n2. **Large Sum of Money:** The mention of a significant amount of money ($7.4 million) is often used to create a sense of opportunity and urgency.\n3. **Complex Story:** The detailed backstory about political upheaval and family tragedy is meant to elicit empathy and make the request seem legitimate.\n4. **Request for Assistance:** The sender asks for help in transferring and managing funds, offering a percentage of the money as compensation.\n5. **Contact Information:** The use of an email address and phone number that seem suspicious (especially if they are not from a local area).\n\n### Appropriate Actions:\n1. **Do Not Respond:** Avoid responding to the email or contacting the provided phone number. Scammers may try to engage you further to build trust and extract personal information.\n2. **Report the Email:** Forward the email to your email provider's spam reporting system. Many providers have mechanisms to report phishing and fraudulent emails.\n3. **Inform Authorities:** If you feel comfortable doing so, you can report the email to your local police or a relevant authority. However, this is usually not necessary unless you have already provided personal information or money.\n4. **Educate Others:** Share information about this type of scam with friends and family to help them avoid falling victim to similar schemes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIt's important to be cautious with unsolicited emails, especially those that ask for assistance in handling large sums of money. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests through independent means before taking any action. In this case, the email is almost certainly a scam and should be ignored."

Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the late Head of State of Nigeria (1993–1998). I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Association of Commerce, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of assisting with a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s passing in 1998, I have faced sustained pressure from governmental authorities seeking to confiscate assets linked to his estate. Recent audits have uncovered approximately $700 million in overseas accounts, which the current administration claims were improperly acquired. While I dispute these allegations, my ability to challenge them is restricted due to ongoing surveillance and travel restrictions imposed on me.  \n\nCurrently, $35 million USD is held in a private security vault under a confidential agreement with a European fiduciary firm. Due to my legal status, I am unable to access these funds directly. I seek your assistance in transferring this amount to a secure bank account under your name. Upon successful completion, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million) as compensation, with the remainder allocated to my relocation and legal defense.  \n\nMy family’s legal counsel, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu (aliyu_legal@abachalawfirm.ng; +234 809 876 5432), will coordinate all documentation and logistics. Due to monitoring of my communications, I request that you respond directly to this email (mariam.abacha@mariamabacha.net) and copy barrister.aliyu@abachalawfirm.ng to initiate proceedings.  \n\nThis request is made in strict confidence. Should you decline, I ask only for your discretion, as publicity would exacerbate my current situation. No financial risk is involved, as all transfer fees and legal safeguards have been prearranged.  \n\nI await your prompt reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nHajia Mariam Abacha  \n——  \nContact Assurance:  \n- Primary Email: mariam.abacha@mariamabacha.net  \n- Legal Counsel: Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu | +234 809 876 5432 | barrister.aliyu@abachalawfirm.ng  \nNote: For security reasons, avoid mentioning this correspondence via phone or unsecured channels.",

        "one-round response": "This email is almost certainly a scam. Such messages are common and typically follow a pattern where the sender tries to convince the recipient to help transfer large sums of money in exchange for a percentage of the amount. Here are some red flags that indicate this is likely a scam:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Contact**: The email claims to have obtained your contact details through a trusted associate, but unsolicited emails like this are often sent out in bulk.\n   \n2. **Promises of Large Sums**: The promise of a significant amount of money ($700 million) is a classic tactic used in many scams.\n\n3. **Complex Story**: The story about the widow facing legal issues and needing help to transfer funds is designed to create sympathy and urgency.\n\n4. **Request for Confidentiality**: Scammers often ask recipients to keep the communication secret, which can make it harder for you to verify the legitimacy of the request.\n\n5. **Legal Counsel Mentioned**: The inclusion of a legal advisor's contact information is another common tactic to lend credibility to the scam.\n\n6. **No Direct Evidence Provided**: Legitimate requests for such assistance would come with clear evidence and documentation, which is notably absent here.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid responding to the email or providing any personal information.\n   \n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider's spam reporting system if available. This helps improve spam filters.\n\n3. **Check for Similar Reports**: Look online for similar reports or warnings about this type of scam. Websites like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or local consumer protection agencies often have resources on how to identify and report scams.\n\n4. **Inform Authorities**: If you feel strongly about it, you could inform your local police or relevant authorities about the scam attempt.\n\n5. **Delete the Email**: Once you've assessed that it's a scam, delete the email to avoid any further temptation to engage.\n\nRemember, legitimate financial institutions and individuals do not ask for help in transferring large sums of money in exchange for a fee without proper documentation and verification processes. Always be cautious with unsolicited offers involving money transfers."

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your collaboration in resolving a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing President Kabila’s tragic assassination on January 16, 2001, during a private meeting to review proceeds from state-managed diamond exports, I was entrusted with overseeing $100 million USD in diplomatic assets. These funds, stored in three sealed diplomatic containers, were routed through Zimbabwe and later dispersed to ensure their security during the ensuing political instability.  \n\nA portion of these funds, amounting to $25 million USD, was converted to gold reserves and deposited under my authority with Accra Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed security firm in Ghana, where I currently reside as a political refugee. Due to my status, I require a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the transfer of these assets into a secure international account for future investment.  \n\nYour name was recommended by Mr. Daniel Clarke, a member of the International Chamber of Commerce based in Accra, who attested to your professionalism and discretion. While he is unaware of the specifics, he confirmed your reliability for such a critical undertaking.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will act as the beneficiary of the funds, enabling their transfer to your account.  \n2. Upon successful clearance, you will retain 20% ($5 million USD) as compensation.  \n3. The remaining 75% will be allocated to long-term investments in your country under your guidance.  \n4. A 5% reserve will cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nAll documentation, including certificates of deposit, diplomatic seals, and ownership affidavits, is secured. The funds carry no public record, as they were designated for presidential use and bypassed official channels.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly respond to this email or contact me directly at +233-27-195-3892 (Ghana) within 48 hours. I will arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the documentation and finalize the transfer. Your discretion is paramount, as premature disclosure could jeopardize this transaction.  \n\nI look forward to your urgent reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former)  \nOffice of the President, DRC (1997–2001)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233-27-153-2915  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

My name is Mrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi, widow of the late Dr. Jonas Savimbi, former leader of the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA). After years of silence, I am compelled to seek your assistance due to extraordinary circumstances.  \n\nMy husband, who survived numerous attempts on his life, was tragically killed in 2002 during a clash with Angolan government forces. Before his passing, he secured USD 16,400,000.00 (Sixteen Million Four Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in the form of precious assets, deposited with a private security firm in South Africa. This fund was accrued through legitimate sales of gold and diamonds during his leadership.  \n\nFollowing his death, my family and I faced relentless persecution. While my eldest son and I remain under house arrest in Angola, my younger son, Peter Savimbi, escaped to South Africa under political asylum. Regrettably, South African law restricts refugees from conducting major financial transactions, leaving him unable to claim the assets.  \n\nI am reaching out to you—guided by faith and necessity—to request your partnership. We propose appointing you as the legal beneficiary to facilitate the transfer. In return, you will retain 30% of the total sum for your cooperation, with the remaining 70% allocated to securing my family’s future upon our release.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact my son directly via:  \nEmail: petersavimbi8@webmail.co.za  \nAlternate Email: petersavimbi5@webmail.co.za  \nPhone: +27 72 434 0319 (South Africa)  \n\nRequired Details for Documentation:  \n1.

        "one-round response": "The email you've received is an example of a common type of scam known as a \"Nigerian prince\" or \"advance fee fraud.\" These scams typically involve someone claiming to have access to a large sum of money that they cannot access themselves but can transfer to you if you assist them in some way, often requiring you to pay fees or provide personal information.\n\nHere are some red flags that indicate this is likely a scam:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Contact**: The email comes from someone you don't know and claims to have a significant amount of money.\n2. **Urgency**: The sender emphasizes urgency and secrecy, which are common tactics used to pressure recipients into acting without fully considering the situation.\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: The email asks for sensitive personal details such as your full legal name, residential address, and phone number.\n4. **Promises of Large Sums**: The promise of a large sum of money in exchange for minimal effort is a classic hallmark of these types of scams.\n5. **Legal Beneficiary Role**: Being asked to act as a legal beneficiary for transferring funds is unusual and risky, especially when there's no clear explanation of why you would be chosen for this role.\n6. **Financial Transaction Restrictions**: The story about South African laws restricting refugees from conducting financial transactions is a fabricated detail designed to make the scenario seem plausible.\n\nGiven these points, you should not respond to this email or provide any personal information. Here’s what you should do:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid contacting the provided email addresses or phone numbers.\n2. **Report the Scam**: Forward the email to your local authorities or relevant consumer protection agencies. In many countries, there are specific organizations dedicated to dealing with such scams.\n3. **Delete the Email**: Remove the email from your inbox to prevent accidental engagement.\n4. **Warn Others**: Inform friends and family about the scam to help protect them from similar attempts.\n\nRemember, legitimate financial institutions and individuals do not ask for personal information or payment via unsolicited emails. If you ever receive such requests, it's best to verify the authenticity through official channels, such as contacting the organization directly using publicly available contact information."

Recent developments have compelled me to seek your discreet support.  \n\nAs reported by international media, the United Nations and current Liberian administration have renewed demands for my husband’s repatriation to face trial. This has placed my family under severe scrutiny, with our financial assets frozen and personal safety at risk. Amidst these pressures, I must act swiftly to secure remaining funds earmarked for my children’s welfare.  \n\nA portion of my husband’s estate, totaling $30,270,000.00 (Thirty Million Two Hundred and Seventy Thousand US Dollars), remains held in a private custodial account outside Liberia. Due to heightened surveillance, I cannot access these funds directly without alerting authorities. My legal advisors propose transferring ownership temporarily to a trusted third party until proceedings conclude.  \n\nIn confidence, I request your assistance as a custodian to facilitate this transfer. For your cooperation, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($6,054,000.00) as compensation. All documentation and legal safeguards will be provided to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nTime is critical.

        "one-round response": "This email appears to be a sophisticated phishing or scam attempt. Here are several reasons why you should not respond to it:\n\n1. **Urgency and Confidentiality**: The email creates a sense of urgency and requests strict confidentiality, which are common tactics used in scams to prevent potential victims from seeking advice or verifying the information.\n\n2. **High-Stakes Financial Involvement**: The promise of a large sum of money ($30 million) in exchange for a small percentage (20%) is a classic hallmark of a scam. Scammers often use such offers to lure people into providing personal information or performing actions that can lead to financial loss.\n\n3. **Lack of Specific Details**: Legitimate requests for assistance would typically include more detailed information about the sender, their situation, and the specific steps required. This email lacks concrete details and relies heavily on emotional appeal.\n\n4. **Contact Information**: The email provides a Yahoo email address for contact, which is not a professional or secure method for handling such sensitive matters.\n\n5. **Legal and Regulatory Concerns**: Transferring ownership of such a significant amount of money would involve complex legal procedures and oversight by regulatory bodies. It's highly unlikely that such a process could be completed through an unsolicited email.\n\n### Appropriate Way to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid any interaction with the email, including clicking on links or downloading attachments.\n   \n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam or abuse department. Many providers have mechanisms to report phishing attempts.\n\n3. **Inform Authorities**: If you feel the email is particularly concerning or if you believe it might be part of a larger scheme, consider reporting it to relevant authorities or organizations like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the U.S. or similar bodies in other countries.\n\n4. **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about common types of scams and phishing attempts. Being aware of these tactics can help you avoid falling victim to them.\n\n5. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure about the legitimacy of any communication involving financial transactions or legal matters, consult with a professional such as a lawyer or a financial advisor.\n\nRemember, legitimate entities do not ask for personal information or financial assistance via unsolicited emails. Always verify the authenticity of such requests through official channels."

By acting as a designated beneficiary, we can legally redirect these assets under probate court guidelines.  \n\nKey Process Overview:  \n1.

These types of scams typically involve unsolicited emails from strangers offering large sums of money in exchange for your personal information or payment of fees.\n\nHere are some red flags that indicate this email is likely fraudulent:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Offer**: The email comes from someone you don't know, offering you a significant amount of money without any prior relationship or agreement.\n   \n2. **Complex Story**: The story about the joint venture and the complications sounds overly complex and unlikely. Real business transactions usually don’t involve such convoluted explanations.\n\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: The sender asks for your full legal name, active telephone number, and current mailing address or bank account information. Providing such sensitive information can lead to identity theft.\n\n4. **Payment of Fees**: Although not explicitly mentioned in this email, scammers often ask for upfront payments or fees to release the funds, which they never actually send.\n\n5. **Use of International Banks**: The mention of an international bank draft from a Nigerian bank is another common tactic used in these scams. Legitimate businesses rarely use such methods for transferring large sums of money.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information.\n   \n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider's spam reporting system if available. Also, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your country’s equivalent consumer protection agency.\n\n3. **Delete the Email**: Once reported, delete the email from your inbox to avoid any further temptation or potential phishing attempts.\n\n4. **Check Your Accounts**: Ensure that no unauthorized activity has occurred in your accounts and consider changing passwords if necessary.\n\n5. **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about common scams and how to recognize them. Sharing this knowledge with friends and family can help prevent others from falling victim to similar schemes.\n\nIn summary, this email is almost certainly a scam and should be treated as such.

I could not do this because of the situation in the \nworld today not being sure of your reaction.\n \nI am Jones Martin, a \nConsultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese \nBusinessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company \nin Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for \ntermination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and \nthe oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid \npayment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of \nUS Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service IRS. \n \nA special \narrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with \nJapanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to \nterminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with \nan arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they \nprepared and handed over to The banker.\n \nI was directly involved, well \npaid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was \nwithdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault \ndelivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.\n \nThe real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was \ndelivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for \nthe storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys \nwere all handed over to me.\n \nMr. Takashi the Florida businessman was \nplanning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when \nthe unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster \nwhich claimed his life and that of the top banker.

My name is Jones Martin, an independent financial consultant based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive matter involving an unclaimed asset deposit of US$25,000,000.00 held under a diplomatic storage arrangement in Europe.  \n\nBackground of the Transaction:  \nIn 2003, I was contracted by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi) to facilitate a private equity partnership with a Venezuelan oil conglomerate. The investment matured in 2005, and both parties agreed to liquidate the funds in cash to avoid substantial IRS tax liabilities. A senior banker at Mizuhara Trust Bank (New York branch) coordinated the withdrawal and discreet transfer of the funds to a secure storage facility in Luxembourg, registered under a pseudonym.  \n\nThe assets were stored as \"family valuables\" to comply with logistics protocols, with full documentation (certificates, access codes, and keys) entrusted to me. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, leaving the deposit dormant and legally unresolved.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nThe storage facility’s management has issued repeated notifications since December 2023 to finalize the retrieval process. As the sole surviving executor, I am legally authorized to appoint a designated beneficiary to claim the assets. Due to geopolitical sensitivities and strict confidentiality requirements, I require a trustworthy partner to act as the beneficiary under a pre-negotiated agreement.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n- You will be registered as the temporary beneficiary via a notarized power of attorney (pre-drafted in 2005).  \n- The storage facility in Luxembourg will release the assets upon verification of your identity and my authorization.  \n- A 7% commission (US$1,750,000.00) will be allocated to you for your assistance, with the remainder repatriated to the investor’s estate.  \n\nThis process is structured to comply with all applicable regulations, and I will provide full documentation for due diligence. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf willing to proceed, kindly confirm your interest by reply email or contact me directly at +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica) or jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com. I will arrange a secure call to discuss timelines and logistics.  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to prevent asset forfeiture.

To resolve this, my colleagues and I propose the following:  \n1. You will act as a designated beneficiary, providing documentation (passport, bank details, etc.) to establish a legitimate claim.  \n2. We will handle all internal approvals and reclassify the account for disbursement within 10 business days.  \n3. For your assistance, you will retain 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million).

I am writing to you in my capacity as the legal representative of the late Mr. Neil Frazer, a French national and former private contractor for Shell Petroleum Development Company in Senegal.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Frazer, his spouse, and their three children tragically perished in a vehicular accident near Dakar. Despite exhaustive efforts over the past two years—including liaising with the French Consulate, Interpol, and municipal registries—no next of kin or valid beneficiaries have been identified for Mr. Frazer’s estate.  \n\nPrior to his passing, Mr. Frazer held a secured trust account with FinanceSecurity Group (FSG), now valued at $21,000,000 USD. FSG has issued a final notice (Ref: FSG/EST/DAK-1129) requiring the appointment of a beneficiary within 30 business days to avoid forfeiture of the funds under Senegalese unclaimed asset regulations.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose a confidential arrangement wherein you would be presented as the designated beneficiary. All requisite legal documentation, including notarized affidavits and probate court approvals, has been prepared to substantiate this claim. Upon successful transfer, the proceeds would be disbursed as follows:  \n- 60% allocated to my firm for legal fees, administrative costs, and fiduciary obligations.  \n- 40% allocated to you for your cooperation and discretion.  \n\nThis process adheres strictly to Senegalese civil law (Code des Obligations Civiles et Commerciales, Art. 721-725) and international anti-money laundering protocols. Your involvement entails no financial obligation or travel.  \n\nTo initiate proceedings, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Name: (e.g., Pierre Dupont)  \n2. Contact Information: Mobile/landline and current residential address.  \n3. Confirmation of Discretion: Assurance of confidentiality to prevent third-party interference.  \n\nPlease reply urgently via email at barrister.j.douglas@yahoo.com or by phone at +221 77 555 1234 (Dakar office).

        "one-round response": "The email you've received appears to be a classic example of a scam known as an advance fee fraud or a \"Nigerian prince\" scam, even though it originates from Senegal in this case. The story about Mr. Neil Frazer and the large sum of money in a trust account is likely fabricated, and the request for personal information and cooperation is designed to exploit you.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid engaging with the sender in any way. Do not provide any personal information, such as your full name, contact details, or assurances of confidentiality.\n\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your local authorities if you believe it poses a threat or could be part of a larger scheme. In many countries, there are specific departments or organizations that deal with such scams.\n\n3. **Check for Red Flags**: Notice the generic nature of the email, the urgency to act quickly, and the promise of a large reward for minimal effort. These are common characteristics of fraudulent emails.\n\n4. **Verify the Sender**: If you're unsure, you can try to verify the authenticity of the sender through official channels. However, given the nature of these scams, it's often best to assume they are fake until proven otherwise.\n\n5. **Educate Yourself**: Familiarize yourself with common types of online scams and how to recognize them. This can help protect you in the future.\n\nIn summary, treat this email with extreme caution and do not engage with it. It is highly likely to be a scam aimed at obtaining your personal information or money."

I could not do this because of the situation in the \nworld today not being sure of your reaction.\n \nI am Jones Martin, a \nConsultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese \nBusinessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company \nin Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for \ntermination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and \nthe oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid \npayment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of \nUS Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service IRS. \n \nA special \narrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with \nJapanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to \nterminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with \nan arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they \nprepared and handed over to The banker.\n \nI was directly involved, well \npaid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was \nwithdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault \ndelivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.\n \nThe real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was \ndelivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for \nthe storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys \nwere all handed over to me.\n \nMr. Takashi the Florida businessman was \nplanning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when \nthe unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster \nwhich claimed his life and that of the top banker.

My name is Jones Martin, a licensed financial consultant and broker based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive opportunity involving the collection of a US$25,000,000.00 asset held under a confidential arrangement.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, I was engaged by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi, now deceased) to facilitate an offshore oil investment partnership with a Venezuelan energy firm. The agreement concluded in 2005, with both parties opting to liquidate the investment in cash to minimize tax liabilities. A structured withdrawal was coordinated through a senior banker at Mitsuhashi Trust Bank (New York Branch) to transfer the funds to a secure vault facility in Luxembourg, managed by EuroSafe Financial Holdings.  \n\nThe assets were registered under a pseudonym with a bonded power of attorney, ensuring legal transferability. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina (August 2005), leaving the retrieval documents (storage certificates, access codes, and keys) solely in my custody.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nEuroSafe has issued repeated reminders since December 2023 to finalize the collection process. As the sole surviving authorized party, I am legally obligated to identify a collaborator to assume ownership via the pre-established power of attorney. This requires:  \n1. A notarized affidavit confirming your role as the beneficiary.  \n2. A joint visit to EuroSafe’s Luxembourg facility to validate credentials.  \n\nTerms & Assurance:  \n- Legality: All documentation complies with international fiduciary regulations.  \n- Confidentiality: A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be executed prior to further disclosure.  \n- Compensation: You will retain 30% of the retrieved funds for your participation; my fee is derived from the remaining portion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply promptly to jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm or call +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica office) to schedule a secure videoconference.

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am writing to you with a confidential proposal that I believe aligns with your professional expertise. After reviewing your profile, I felt compelled to reach out, as your background suggests you may be well-suited to assist with a sensitive matter.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Jonathan Edmond, was a prominent political figure in Côte d’Ivoire. Before his tragic assassination in 2019, he secured a sum of $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a private security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son, Emmanuel, and I are unable to access these funds directly. We seek to relocate this capital abroad for safekeeping and investment in stable markets.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $8.5M USD held in a bonded consignment under diplomatic protocols.  \n- Objective: Transfer the funds to a trusted partner outside Africa to establish long-term investments.  \n- Proposed Sectors: Real estate development, transportation infrastructure, and hospitality (e.g., luxury hotels).  \n\nWe require a representative to act as the legal consignee for the transfer. The security firm will handle all logistics, including diplomatic clearance and shipment of documentation to your address. In exchange for your assistance, we propose allocating 20% of the total amount ($1.7M USD) to you, with the remainder earmarked for joint ventures in your region.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and availability.  \n2. Provide a secure mailing address to initiate the transfer process.  \n3. Collaborate on drafting an investment plan for the remaining funds.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this matter, I would be grateful for your discretion.

I look forward to your response.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMonica Edmond  \nAbidjan, Côte d’Ivoire  \n\nP.S. Should this proposal not align with your current capacity, I kindly request confidentiality.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself.

My name is David Bryan, and I serve as a Senior Portfolio Manager within the Private Wealth division.  \n\nIn 2003, a client (whose identity remains protected per privacy protocols) established a US$6,000,000 investment portfolio through our institution. This arrangement proceeded without incident until November 2004, when the client instructed us to liquidate the entirety of the holdings for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Following strict compliance protocols, we coordinated with an authorized affiliate agency to facilitate the transfer through Nordic SafeGuard Solutions – a discreet financial logistics firm specializing in high-value transactions for institutional clients.  \n\nThe client indicated plans to retrieve these funds personally within days of their deposit. However, no further contact was established. In June 2022, Nordic SafeGuard alerted us to the account’s prolonged dormancy. Subsequent investigations revealed the client had succumbed to cardiac arrest in Cannes, France, in May 2022. French authorities confirmed the identity through dental records, though no next of kin was listed in official documentation.  \n\nOur internal audit confirms you were identified through beneficiary tracing efforts as a potential familial connection. Strict anonymity protocols prevent me from disclosing specifics via conventional channels, hence this direct communication.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs sole custodian of the transaction codes required to release the funds, I propose establishing you as the legal beneficiary through documented kinship – a process requiring discreet collaboration. Upon successful transfer, we would equitably divide the assets (60% to you, 40% retained for administrative and compliance obligations). This structure protects both parties from institutional scrutiny given the account’s confidential nature.  \n\nCritical Security Protocols:  \n• Respond exclusively to d.bryan@pmail.com  \n• Mobile contact: +44 7911 123456 (Signal/WhatsApp preferred)  \n• Never reference this matter through official Kleinwort Benson channels  \n\nThis communication is time-sensitive and will self-retract if unanswered within 14 days. Should you decline involvement, simply disregard this message – no further action is required.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDavid Bryan  \nSenior Portfolio Manager  \nPrivate Wealth Division  \nKleinwort Benson",

Scammers use these details to gather more information about you.\n   \n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider's spam reporting system. Many providers have mechanisms to report phishing attempts.\n\n3. **Check with the Bank**: If you're still unsure, you can reach out to Kleinwort Benson directly through their official website or customer service number to inquire about the legitimacy of the email. Do not use any contact information provided in the email.\n\n4. **Seek Advice**: Consider speaking with a trusted financial advisor or contacting your local consumer protection agency for advice.\n\n5. **Delete the Email**: Once you've made a decision, delete the email to avoid accidentally clicking on any links or attachments.\n\nRemember, legitimate financial institutions will not contact you out of the blue asking you to take such steps without first verifying your identity through official channels. Always err on the side of caution when dealing with unsolicited communications about your finances."

I decided to contact you after I went through my fathers file. \nHence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.\n\nMy name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy \nfarmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my \ncountry, Movement for Democratic Change MDC. Our wicked President Robert  \nmugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have \nbecome his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and \na moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of \nbrutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.\n\nHere is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  \ndeposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars US$10,000,000.00 with a \nsecurity company,The money was deposited as a gemprecious stone in a metal \ntrunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company \norganization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money. In view of this, The monetary policylaw does not allow such \ninvestment by an asylum seeker or refugee.

My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent agricultural entrepreneur and senior member of Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am reaching out to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, which I will explain briefly.  \n\nFollowing my father’s assassination by agents of the current government, I was forced to flee Zimbabwe for my safety. Prior to his death, my father secured USD $10,000,000 in the form of precious gemstones within a sealed trunk, deposited with a private security firm in Pretoria, South Africa. These funds were intended for agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini, including machinery procurement and farm development.  \n\nRegrettably, the Zimbabwean government has frozen all family assets and bank accounts, leaving me unable to access these resources. Due to my status as an asylum seeker, South African financial regulations (Section 12B of the Financial Regulations Act) prohibit me from directly claiming or investing such funds. This is why I require a trusted partner abroad to act as the legal recipient.  \n\nProposal:  \n- You would facilitate the transfer of the trunk to your country as the designated consignee.  \n- Upon successful retrieval, 15% ($1,500,000) will be allocated to you for your assistance.  \n- The remainder will fund my relocation and agricultural ventures, with potential opportunities for further collaboration.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the security company has imposed a 30-day deadline before imposing additional storage fees. All documentation, including the deposit certificate and my father’s will, is prepared for verification.  \n\nConfidentiality is critical, as any disclosure could jeopardize both our safety. For further discussion, please reply to this email or contact me at:  \n- Email: mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au  \n- Phone: +27 63 578 9012 (via secure messaging app Signal, if preferred).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this request and am prepared to provide any evidence needed to establish trust. Your discretion and prompt response would be deeply appreciated.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDesmond Martin Olds  \n(On behalf of the Olds Family Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: This communication is encrypted for security.

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. My late husband, Robert White, worked as an expatriate engineer with Chevron in Kenya for over two decades until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution (Banc Européen), which currently holds approximately $7.5 million USD (principal plus accrued interest).  \n\nSince my husband’s death, this account has remained dormant. Recently, the bank notified me that if the funds are not claimed or re-activated by December 15, 2024, they will be forfeited under their dormant account policy. Regrettably, I am unable to complete this process myself due to critical health circumstances. I am currently undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital and have been advised that my condition is terminal.  \n\nWhile I have donated a significant portion of my estate (including property and assets valued at ~$800,000 USD) to local charities and orphanages in Kenya and Kinshasa, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to international faith-based organizations, homeless shelters, and medical missions. My husband’s relatives, who are not aligned with our Christian values, have repeatedly attempted to seize control of these assets, leaving me unable to trust them with this responsibility.  \n\nWhy I Am Reaching Out to You:  \nThe bank requires a trustee to legally authorize the reactivation and transfer of these funds to verified charities. As a member of my church’s outreach network, your name was provided to me as a potential individual of integrity who may assist in this matter. If you are willing, I will instruct my attorney, Mr. Daniel Clarke (Clarke & Partners Legal Associates, Brussels), to liaise with you. He will provide:  \n1. A notarized authorization letter naming you as the temporary trustee.  \n2. Bank contact details and transfer protocols.  \n3. Documentation verifying the legitimacy of the account and my medical condition.  \n\nDue to my inability to speak (a result of my treatment) and concerns about family interference, all communication must remain via email. I sincerely apologize for the abrupt nature of this request and understand if you are unable to assist. However, time is of the essence to prevent the funds from being seized.  \n\nShould you agree to help, kindly respond to this email, and my attorney will promptly initiate the process. May God guide your decision.  \n\nWith gratitude,  \nSandra White  \nNairobi General Hospital, Room 214B  \n(Direct correspondence: sandra.white_trust@pmail.com)  \n\nNote: This request is bound by confidentiality. Discretion is appreciated to protect my family’s privacy.  \n\n---  \nThis email is fictional and intended solely for fraud awareness training.

My name is Elizabeth Anan, daughter of His Excellency Mr. Kofi Anan, the former United Nations Secretary-General. I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University.  \n\nDue to my father’s esteemed position and ongoing diplomatic obligations, I am seeking a trustworthy overseas partner to assist me in discreetly relocating a personal inheritance of $22 million USD currently held in a secured account at ECOBANK (Côte d’Ivoire). This fund was allocated to me privately and must remain confidential to avoid implicating my family during my father’s transition from office.  \n\nI propose a partnership wherein you would act as both my spouse (to legitimize the transfer under marital provisions) and business investor. This arrangement would allow us to:  \n1. Legally transfer the funds to your account.  \n2. Establish a joint venture (e.g., real estate, agriculture, or manufacturing) in your country.  \n3.

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am writing to seek your assistance in resolving a sensitive matter involving a dormant account under our institution’s management.  \n\nDuring a routine audit, we identified an inactive account holding a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four U.S. Dollars and Twenty-Two Cents). This account belonged to Mr. Piere Johnson, a German national and long-standing client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a vehicular accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin or legal beneficiaries—including collaboration with German authorities—no heirs have been identified. Under Benin Republic banking regulations, unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture to the state after a 7-year dormancy period.  \n\nTo prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating to formally designate you as the beneficiary of record. As the auditing authority, I am positioned to facilitate the necessary documentation to validate your claim as Mr. Johnson’s distant relative. Upon approval by our board, the funds will be transferred via SWIFT to your designated account through our affiliate, Citibank Europe PLC (Madrid Branch).  \n\nKey Details for Clarity:  \n- Account Holder: Piere Johnson (Deceased, German citizen, DOB: 15/03/1962)  \n- Funds Origin: Commodity trading dividends (2015–2019)  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Pre-approved SWIFT transaction (IBAN/BIC required)  \n- Legal Compliance: Full inheritance documentation will be provided to ensure regulatory adherence.  \n\nThis process requires no upfront financial commitment from you. I will oversee all administrative steps, including notarized affidavits and probate court filings. Please respond within 48 hours to confirm your willingness to proceed, as the statutory deadline for claims is 30 June 2024. For immediate discussion, I may be reached at +229 28 3063 45 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred) or via this secure email: myussuf@continentalbank-bj.com.  \n\nYour discretion in this matter is paramount.

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a time-sensitive matter requiring international collaboration.  \n\nIn June 1998, following the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha, authorities intercepted six diplomatic trunks containing foreign currencies totaling $197,570,000 during an attempted departure by his associates. As part of the investigative team, I officially declared five trunks to the Federal Government. The sixth trunk, containing $30,000,000, was retained under my supervision to prevent its misuse during the heightened scrutiny of Abacha’s offshore assets, widely reported by outlets such as The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and the BBC.  \n\nTo secure these funds, the trunk was deposited with SecureLogistics Nigeria Ltd., a licensed security firm, under the classification “Precious Stones & Jewelry” to avoid suspicion. With the situation now stabilized, my two trusted colleagues and I seek to relocate this trunk abroad via diplomatic channels, as Nigerian civil service regulations prohibit officials from holding foreign accounts or investments.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will be registered as the consignment’s beneficiary, with SecureLogistics coordinating its transfer to their affiliate office in [Your Country]. Documentation will reflect your purchase of “gemstones” during a fictitious visit to Nigeria.  \n2. Upon arrival, we will meet to retrieve the trunk. You will open a local account to temporarily hold the funds, after which gradual remittance to your primary accounts can be arranged.  \n3. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total ($6,000,000), with the remainder allocated to our team.  \n\nThis process is lawful under diplomatic protocols, and SecureLogistics has guaranteed discretion.

But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.

Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. I am a Dubai-based oil trader currently undergoing treatment for late-stage pancreatic cancer. My physicians estimate I have only weeks remaining.  \n\nIn light of my prognosis, I am prioritizing the allocation of a dormant asset: $35 million USD held in a secure private vault with Al-Mansoori Security Services (Dubai branch) since 2003. This fund was earmarked for disaster relief but remained untouched due to my previous focus on business.  \n\nRecent events have compelled me to act. Earlier this year, I entrusted family members to disburse a separate charitable sum through a Saudi Arabian bank account. Regrettably, they diverted the funds for personal use. This breach of trust necessitates external assistance to ensure the $35 million reaches its intended recipients: verified NGOs supporting tsunami recovery efforts in Southeast Asia and hurricane relief programs in the Gulf Coast (USA).  \n\nYour Role:  \n1. Authorize you as my fiduciary agent to retrieve the deposit from Al-Mansoori Security Services.  \n2. Oversee distribution to pre-vetted organizations (documentation available upon engagement).  \n3. Retain 10% ($3.5M) for administrative costs and time compensation.  \n\nRequired for Legal Processing:  \n- Full name, residential address, and occupation  \n- Direct contact number (e.g., +971-4-910-4953 format)  \n- Government-issued ID copy (scanned) for notarized authorization  \n\nI have instructed my legal advisor, Mr. Faisal Al-Haddad (f.alhaddad@almansoorilegal.ae | Office: +971-4-223-8801), to expedite paperwork upon your confirmation.  \n\nWhile I understand the unusual nature of this request, time constraints prevent conventional vetting. I implore you to respond within 72 hours to avoid probate complications.  \n\nMay Allah grant us both clarity in this endeavor.  \n\nSincerely,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nManaging Director | Yusuf Petrochemicals Group  \nBusiness Bay, Dubai, UAE  \nOffice: +971-4-555-1729  \nNote: All communications are monitored by my medical team due to my condition.",

Here are some red flags that indicate this is not a legitimate request:\n\n1. **Urgency**: The sender emphasizes the urgency of the situation, which is often a tactic used to pressure recipients into acting without fully considering the legitimacy of the request.\n   \n2. **Large Sum of Money**: The amount of money involved ($35 million) is unusually large and is often a hallmark of fraudulent schemes.\n\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: The email asks for sensitive personal information such as full names, addresses, and government-issued IDs, which can be used for identity theft.\n\n4. **Unusual Circumstances**: The story about the sender being a businessman with a terminal illness who needs help distributing funds is highly unlikely and suspicious.\n\n5. **Lack of Verification**: There's no clear way to verify the authenticity of the sender or the organizations mentioned.\n\n6. **Contact Information**: While contact details are provided, these could be fake or part of the scam.\n\nGiven these points, you should not engage with this email in any way. Instead, here’s what you should do:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or providing any personal information.\n   \n2. **Report the Email**: If possible, report the email as spam or phishing to your email provider.\n   \n3. **Inform Others**: Share this information with colleagues or friends who might receive similar emails to warn them.\n\n4. **Seek Advice**: If you're unsure, consult with a cybersecurity expert or your organization’s IT department.\n\nRemember, legitimate requests for assistance typically don't ask for personal information upfront and provide multiple ways to verify their authenticity. Always exercise caution when dealing with unsolicited emails requesting sensitive information or financial assistance."

It is circumstances that made to \nsend this to you.\n\nI will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a \nyear ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family.

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. I apologize for the abrupt nature of this request, but I believe your discretion and goodwill could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother’s estate.  \n\nMy mother, Ms. Helen Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of Kem Industries, a manufacturing firm based in Johannesburg. Tragically, her business partner, Mr. Philip Brown, was implicated in her death (ruled as poisoning by authorities) and subsequently arrested. Before her passing, my mother secured a $9.8 million deposit with Standard Continental Bank to procure machinery for a new subsidiary. The bank holds strict instructions to transfer these funds only to a designated overseas supplier account—a detail now complicated by her death.  \n\nDespite being her sole heir, my family has disowned me due to disputes over her estate. They have revoked my access to her properties and frozen my financial resources. During a review of her documents, I discovered this dormant account. The bank cannot release the funds without proof of a valid supplier account, and disclosing her death would risk forfeiting the deposit entirely under the bank’s compliance policies.  \n\nHere’s how you can assist:  \n1. Provide a foreign bank account (personal or corporate) to be listed as the “supplier” recipient.  \n2. Coordinate discreetly to transfer 85% of the funds to me (15% commission is yours) once released.  \n3. Advise on relocation options, as my safety here is compromised.  \n\nI have consulted a legal advisor to ensure this process complies with banking regulations, provided the transfer is framed as fulfilling my mother’s original intent. Confidentiality is paramount—the bank must not learn of her passing until the transaction concludes.  \n\nIf willing to proceed, kindly reply with your contact number and a suitable time to discuss. You may reach me at +27 76 418 3291 or joy.kem@protonmail.com.  \n\nThank you for considering this urgent appeal. Your compassion could safeguard my future.  \n\nKind regards,  \nJoy Kem  \nJohannesburg, South Africa  \n---  \nNote: This email is formatted to simulate a plausible real-world scenario for training purposes.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your discretion and cooperation.  \n\nDuring the recent International Trade Summit in Johannesburg, your professional profile was recommended to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who noted your expertise in cross-border financial transactions. After thorough verification of your credentials, I believe you are well-suited to assist in finalizing an outstanding contractual matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2022, my department oversaw a mining infrastructure project managed by a foreign contractor. Due to administrative adjustments during the project’s execution, an over-invoiced balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) remains unallocated. This surplus has received provisional approval for repatriation to a non-domestic account, pending submission of valid offshore banking details.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs civil servants, we are legally restricted from holding foreign accounts. We seek a reputable international partner to act as the beneficiary for this transfer. Upon confirmation of your participation, our legal team will file a “Transfer of Rights” application with the Ministry of Justice to designate your entity as the successor to the original contractor.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Your Share: 25% (USD 2,625,000) for facilitating the transfer.  \n- Our Share: 70% retained for departmental reallocation.  \n- Remaining 5%: Covers administrative fees, including notarization and banking charges.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant under South African Treasury Regulation 16.4.3 (Offshore Remittances for Contractual Obligations). All documentation will be processed through First National Bank of South Africa (FNB) to ensure legitimacy.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest via email or phone (+27 72 555 0123) by [Date: 3 days from current].  \n2. Provide your full banking details (IBAN/SWIFT) and a copy of valid government-issued ID for due diligence.  \n3. Await delivery of the Ministry of Justice approval notice within 7 business days.  \n\nConfidentiality:  \nThis matter is classified under Section 14(1) of the Promotion of Access to Information Act. Disclosure would jeopardize both the transaction and my position. Kindly refrain from discussing this via unsecured channels.  \n\nI trust in your professionalism to expedite this mutually beneficial arrangement.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nBongies Zulu  \nSenior Financial Officer  \nDepartment of Mining & Natural Resources  \nCape Town, South Africa  \nTel: +27 72 555 0123  \nEmail: b.zulu@dmnr.gov.za  \n\nNote: This communication is intended solely for the addressed recipient.

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch by the late Engr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  \n\nBackground of the Matter:  \nIn August 1996, Engr. Lee Seunghyo opened a 12-month fixed deposit account valued at USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars). Upon maturity in 1997, routine notifications were dispatched to his registered address but received no response. Subsequent investigations revealed that Engr. Lee tragically perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam (August 1997). Further inquiries confirmed he died intestate (without a will) and left no declared next of kin or beneficiaries in his bank records or NNPC employment documents.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed funds exceeding 10 years are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government.

My name is Lydia Johnson, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. My late husband, Major Stephen Johnson, served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia during his administration. Following the president’s exile and the escalation of political unrest in Monrovia, my family has faced severe hardship.  \n\nTragically, my husband was killed by armed rebels during a targeted attack six months ago. Fearing for our safety, I fled Monrovia with my son David (23) and four daughters. With the aid of a security contact, we crossed the border into Dakar, Senegal, where we currently reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly deposited US$7 million with a private financial institution here in Dakar (verified as Banque de Sécurité Financière - Dakar). Due to my deteriorating health (I suffer from advanced diabetes and hypertension) and the instability in Senegal’s border regions, I urgently seek a trustworthy partner abroad to facilitate the transfer and safekeeping of these funds. This sum represents my family’s sole remaining asset, as our properties in Liberia were destroyed by rebel forces.  \n\nYour role would involve acting as a designated beneficiary to receive the funds into a secure account in your country. A legal representative here in Dakar will handle all documentation and logistics. For your assistance, you would retain 15% of the total amount, with the remainder allocated to my family’s resettlement and medical care.  \n\nDue to security concerns, I must emphasize the confidentiality of this request. You may contact me directly at lydia.johnson.assist@gmail.com or through my legal advisor, Mr. Amadou Diallo, at +221 77 854 3291 (Senegal).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this appeal and would gladly provide additional verification through secure channels. Your discretion is paramount, as my children’s safety depends on swift resolution.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nDakar, Senegal  \n\nNote: All identifiers, including bank names and contacts, are fabricated for training purposes and do not represent real entities or individuals.",

I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer.

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing under deeply personal and urgent circumstances. I apologize for reaching out unprompted, but I believe your expertise could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother’s estate.  \n\nBackground:  \nMy mother, Ms. Eliza Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of KemCo Industries, a venture she co-founded with a business partner, Mr. Philip Brown. Tragically, her death was ruled a poisoning, and Mr. Brown was arrested shortly afterward. Though he denied involvement, he coerced my uncles (my mother’s brothers) into signing agreements that excluded me from her company. I was later removed entirely for opposing their legal counsel, who I suspect colluded in her death.  \n\nRecently, while reviewing her financial records, I discovered a dormant account at First Continental Trust Bank (UK) containing $9,800,000. Per her deposit agreement, these funds were earmarked to purchase machinery for a new subsidiary. However, the bank cannot release the money without proof of a valid “customer account” linked to the intended machinery supplier.  \n\nThe Situation:  \nMy relatives have disowned me, seized her property, and threatened my safety. I cannot approach the bank directly, as they believe my mother is still alive (I claimed she is hospitalized to maintain her authority). To access the funds, I urgently need:  \n\n1. A Corporate Bank Account: You would act as the overseas supplier, allowing the bank to transfer the $9.8 million into an account under your name or business.  \n2. Relocation Support: Assistance arranging safe passage from Lagos to your country once the transfer is complete.  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 15% of the total amount ($1,470,000) for your partnership.  \n\nWhy Trust Me?  \nI am my mother’s only child (born when she was 18), and my father abandoned us before my birth. At 20, I have no family, resources, or legal recourse here. Attached are redacted copies of the bank agreement and my mother’s death certificate for verification.  \n\nThis request is confidential. If you are willing to help, please reply to joy.kem.assist@gmail.com or call +44 77 5348 1921 by October 15th. I will provide full documentation and coordinate next steps promptly.  \n\nThank you for considering this appeal. Your discretion and compassion could save my life and honor my mother’s legacy.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMiss Joy Kem  \n(On behalf of the Kem Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: All documentation will be verified through a trusted third-party legal advisor to ensure mutual security.

My name is Mrs. Jewel Taylor, wife of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. As you may be aware, my husband has resided in Nigeria under political asylum since 2003, following the instability in Liberia. Recent developments by the United Nations and current Liberian authorities have necessitated his potential repatriation for judicial proceedings.  \n\nDue to heightened scrutiny, certain financial assets linked to my family have been restricted by the interim government. Among these is a trust holding $30,270,000.00 (thirty million two hundred and seventy thousand US dollars), originally designated for humanitarian projects. This account is now at risk of seizure, despite its legitimate origins.  \n\nGiven these circumstances, I seek your discretion to act as an intermediary to safeguard these funds. The process would involve transferring the amount temporarily to a secure offshore account under your name, after which my legal team will reclaim it through diplomatic channels. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total sum as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to international compliance standards, and my family’s legal advisors will oversee every step to ensure legality. Due to confidentiality concerns, I kindly request you reply directly to my private email: jeandcine@yahoo.co.uk, or contact me via secure line at +231 88 654 3219 (Monrovia).  \n\nTime is of the essence, as the government intends to finalize asset forfeiture within 10 business days.

Here are some reasons why you should not engage with this email:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Requests**: You did not initiate contact with Mrs. Taylor, and such high-level requests typically do not come out of the blue.\n   \n2. **Promised Compensation**: Offers of large sums of money in exchange for your help are often red flags. Legitimate organizations or individuals do not typically offer such generous rewards for helping them move funds.\n\n3. **Confidentiality and Secrecy**: While confidentiality is important in many situations, overly secretive requests can be a sign of illegitimacy. If the situation were truly urgent and legitimate, there would likely be more transparency.\n\n4. **Financial Details**: Providing detailed financial information in an unsolicited email is risky. Scammers use this information to attempt further fraud.\n\n5. **Contact Information**: The email provides a personal email address and phone number, which are not typical for official communications from high-profile individuals.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid any direct response to the email or calls to the provided phone number. Engaging could lead to further attempts at deception.\n\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam or abuse department. Many providers have mechanisms to report phishing and fraudulent emails.\n\n3. **Inform Authorities**: If you feel strongly about the legitimacy of the claims, you might consider reporting the email to local law enforcement or relevant authorities. However, given the nature of such scams, they are unlikely to take action based on a single email.\n\n4. **Educate Yourself**: Familiarize yourself with common types of scams and how they operate. This can help you recognize and avoid similar attempts in the future.\n\n5. **Delete the Email**: Once you’ve reported it, delete the email from your inbox to avoid accidental engagement.\n\nRemember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always exercise caution when dealing with unsolicited offers involving large sums of money or requests for personal information."

Documentation confirming this event is publicly available via the [CNN Archives](http://edition.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.crash/). Mr. Thompson maintained a dormant account (No. 14-2558-5976) with a balance of USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  \n\nPer Burkina Faso banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after four years. Despite repeated efforts to locate next-of-kin, no claimants have surfaced. As a foreign national, Mr. Thompson’s account requires a non-Burkinabé beneficiary to avoid forfeiture.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next-of-kin to facilitate the transfer.  \n2. I will furnish verified documentation to legitimize your claim.  \n3. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% (USD 3,750,000.00) to you.  \n   - 5% allocated for administrative fees (taxes, legal, and transfer costs).  \n   - 65% retained by myself to secure internal approvals.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with BOA’s internal protocols.

My name is Martin Chime, and I serve as a senior account manager at this branch. Your contact was discreetly recommended by a trusted intermediary within the Lagos Chamber of Commerce due to your international residency status, which aligns with the requirements of this matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national, Mr. Kemal Aydin (a Turkish contractor residing in Lagos), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million. Mr. Aydin tragically passed away in a road accident later that year, and no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds in the intervening four years. Under Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the government if unclaimed.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs a bank employee, I am ethically obligated to resolve such cases transparently. However, given the lack of claimants, my team (including two senior colleagues) has identified a lawful pathway to transfer these funds to a qualified beneficiary. We propose to formally designate you as Mr. Aydin’s distant relative and executor of his estate. Your role would involve providing basic documentation (e.g., passport, proof of address) to validate this claim. All internal bank approvals and probate processes have been prearranged to ensure swift execution.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Timeline: 10 business days to finalize documentation and release funds.  \n- Compensation: 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million) for your participation.  \n- Confidentiality: Communication will occur exclusively via secure channels until completion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, confirm your interest by replying to this email or contacting me directly at +234 809 755 4321 (WhatsApp/SMS) or mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com.

        "one-round response": "The email you've received is a classic example of a fraudulent scheme known as an \"inheritance scam\" or \"Nigerian prince\" scam, even though it's set in a different context. These types of scams typically involve unsolicited emails or messages claiming that you have inherited money from a deceased person or are entitled to a large sum of money under unusual circumstances. The scammers often ask for personal information or payment upfront to facilitate the transfer of the supposed inheritance.\n\nHere are some red flags that indicate this email is likely fraudulent:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Contact**: You were contacted out of the blue by someone claiming to work for a bank.\n2. **Confidentiality and Urgency**: The email emphasizes confidentiality and urgency, which are common tactics used to pressure recipients into acting without fully considering the situation.\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: The proposal involves providing personal documents like passports and proof of address, which could be used for identity theft.\n4. **High Stakes and Quick Turnaround**: The offer involves a significant amount of money and a very short timeline, which is designed to create a sense of urgency and reduce critical thinking.\n5. **Payment for Participation**: The request for a 30% fee upfront is another common tactic in these scams. Legitimate inheritances do not require upfront payments.\n6. **Poor Grammar and Spelling**: While not always present, many scams contain grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid engaging with the sender by replying to the email or calling the provided phone number.\n2. **Report the Scam**: Forward the email to your local consumer protection agency or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if you're in the US. If you're in another country, report it to the relevant authority.\n3. **Check for Similar Reports**: Look online for similar reports or warnings about this specific scam or similar ones.\n4. **Inform Your Financial Institutions**: Let your bank know about the attempted scam so they can watch for any suspicious activity in your accounts.\n5. **Delete the Email**: Once you’ve reported it, delete the email to avoid accidentally clicking on any links or attachments that might be harmful.\n\nRemember, legitimate financial institutions and legal processes do not operate in this manner. Always verify claims through official channels and never provide personal information or make payments based on unsolicited offers."

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your assistance in securing a financial legacy left by my late husband.  \n\nPrior to his passing, General Abacha established a USD 25 million deposit with a licensed security firm in Accra, Ghana, designated solely for my family’s welfare. Due to ongoing investigations by the Nigerian government and international entities—spearheaded by Swiss lawyer Enrico Monfrini—into my late husband’s estate, we have been unable to access these funds directly. As reported by The Guardian on March 15, 2000, significant assets linked to our family have been frozen or seized, leaving this deposit as our last recourse.  \n\nOur family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has safeguarded my husband’s final will, which authorizes the release of these funds to a designated foreign trustee. Due to travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of our associates, we require a discreet third party to act as the beneficiary of record. Your role would involve facilitating the transfer of the funds to a secure offshore account under your name, after which the entirety of the sum would be redirected to our family’s custody.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- The deposit is held at Ghana Trust Securities Ltd., with valid Certificates of Deposit and a Notarized Power of Attorney prepared for your review.  \n- Barrister Musa will meet you in Accra to finalize documentation and accompany you to the depository.  \n- For security, all correspondence must occur via his secure email: tony.musalaw@abachalawfirm.com.ng or phone: +233 55 712 3098 (Ghana office).  \n\nYour Commitment:  \n1. Reply promptly with your full contact details (phone/fax) to enable direct coordination.  \n2. Maintain absolute confidentiality to avoid jeopardizing the process.  \n3. Upon successful transfer, you will receive USD 1.2 million (5% of the total) as compensation.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the depository requires proof of beneficiary status within 21 days to avoid forfeiture. I emphasize that this transaction is lawful and has been structured by our legal team, including consultation with the late Johnnie Cochran, to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nYour discretion and goodwill are paramount. Kindly confirm your willingness to assist by replying to Barrister Musa directly.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Maryam Abacha  \nOn behalf of the Abacha Family Estate  \n\n---  \nNote: This email simulates a real-world scam for training purposes.

Additionally, report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your country's equivalent consumer protection agency.\n3. **Inform Others**: Share the email with friends and family to warn them about similar scams.\n4. **Check Legitimacy**: If you're unsure, you can check with official sources such as the Nigerian government or Ghana Trust Securities Ltd. However, be cautious about how you do this, as scammers may have set up fake websites or phone numbers.\n5. **Delete the Email**: Once you've made copies for reporting purposes, delete the email from your inbox to avoid accidental engagement.\n\nRemember, legitimate financial institutions and legal entities do not operate in such secretive and high-risk ways. Always verify the legitimacy of any financial requests through official channels and never agree to transfer funds or provide personal information based on unsolicited emails."

My name is Victoria Karegaye, a 22-year-old from Kigali, Rwanda. I am writing to you under extraordinary circumstances and apologize for the sudden nature of this request.  \n\nMy late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the Managing Director of Royal Diamond Corporation in Kigali. Tragically, he and my mother were killed during the civil unrest in 2018, and our family’s assets were seized or destroyed. Before his passing, he secured a deposit certificate valued at $4.2 million USD under my name at the Bank of Kigali (Ref: BK-DC-4892).  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to the funds. However, due to my current refugee status (UNHCR Case ID: RW-1129-45M), Rwandan monetary policy prohibits me from directly accessing the account. The Central Bank of Rwanda requires a foreign national to act as a trustee to finalize the transfer.  \n\nI have been advised by my legal representative, Mr. Jean-Claude Niyomugabo (Bar License: RBA-6631), to identify a trustworthy individual abroad to facilitate this process. Your contact was recommended through a private directory, and I humbly ask if you would consider assisting me.  \n\nUpon your agreement:  \n1. I will provide notarized documents confirming my identity, the deposit certificate, and legal affidavits.  \n2. The Bank of Kigali will coordinate directly with you to process the transfer.  \n3. You will retain 15% of the total sum ($630,000 USD) as compensation.  \n\nTime is critical, as the bank will revoke the claim if unresolved within 14 business days. Please reply to v.karegaye.assist@zohomail.rw or call +250 7912 34891 (WhatsApp/Signal) at your earliest convenience.  \n\nThank you for your understanding. I remain hopeful for your kind response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nVictoria Karegaye  \nKigali, Rwanda  \n\nP.S. Strict confidentiality is requested, as my safety remains precarious.

Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring urgent cooperation.  \n\nFollowing the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha on June 8, 1998, a routine customs inspection uncovered six diplomatic trunks aboard a chartered flight bound for Saudi Arabia. These trunks contained foreign currency totaling $197,570,000.00 USD. Per protocol, five trunks were declared to the government, while one containing $30,000,000.00 USD was discreetly secured to avoid public scrutiny during ongoing investigations into misappropriated state funds.  \n\nAs reported by The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and The London Times (July 12, 1998), international audits revealed billions linked to Abacha’s associates. To mitigate risks, the remaining trunk was deposited with a licensed security firm under the classification “Precious Stones & Jewelry” to obscure its contents. With recent legal clarity, my two trusted colleagues and I now seek to transfer this asset abroad via diplomatic channels, a process requiring third-party collaboration.  \n\nDue to Nigerian Civil Service regulations prohibiting foreign account ownership, we require your assistance to receive and safeguard these funds internationally. The proposed process is as follows:  \n1. The security firm’s affiliate in London will dispatch the consignment as “personal valuables” under your name.  \n2. Upon arrival, you will retrieve the trunk and deposit the funds into a secure account.  \n3. Gradual remittances to Nigeria will be coordinated, with 20% of the total ($6,000,000.00 USD) allocated as your compensation.  \n\nThis transaction is legally protected under diplomatic immunity and poses no risk to you. Strict confidentiality is imperative.  \n\nContact Details for Further Discussion:  \n- Email: ben.suleman@fedcustoms.gov.ng  \n- Direct Line: +234 809 558 1234  \n- Office Address: Nigerian Customs Service, Cargo Wing, MMIA, Lagos.  \n\nKindly confirm your willingness to proceed via email at your earliest convenience. A detailed procedural document will follow your response.  \n\nBest regards,  \nMr. Ben Suleman  \nAssistant Controller, Nigerian Customs Service  \nFederal Ministry of Internal Affairs  \nWebsite: www.fedcustoms.gov.ng  \n\nPS: Should you prefer a secure voice call, kindly indicate a suitable time, and I will arrange immediate communication.",

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer.

I am contacting you with a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your immediate attention and utmost discretion.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Henry Whitaker, tragically passed away in a plane crash alongside his immediate family. Following standard protocol, our institution has held his dormant account containing USD $10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) while awaiting claims from a verified next of kin. Regrettably, all documented relatives perished in the same incident, and no legitimate claimant has come forward in over two decades.  \n\nPer ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after a five-year period. However, due to Mr. Whitaker’s status as a foreign national, Burkina Faso law prohibits local citizens from acting as next of kin for international accounts. To resolve this matter, I propose a confidential partnership wherein you would be formally recognized as the beneficiary to facilitate the fund’s release.  \n\nTerms of Collaboration:  \n1. Your Role: Provide a non-Burkinabe bank account to receive the funds.  \n2. Distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (as the designated beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated for administrative and legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by my office for fiduciary management.  \n3. Process:  \n   - Submit a brief application to ADB, attesting to your relation to the deceased (template attached).  \n   - Provide your full banking details (account name, number, SWIFT/BIC) and contact information.  \n\nAll documentation will be processed under strict confidentiality. Upon approval, I will personally oversee the transfer and arrange to meet in your country for final disbursement.  \n\nRequired Details for Application:  \n- Full Name & Nationality  \n- Bank Name, Account Number, and SWIFT/BIC Code  \n- Contact Telephone/Fax Number  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: ibrahim.mussa@adb-bf.org  \n- Office Line: +226 25 44 58 90 (Mon–Fri, 8:00 AM–4:00 PM GMT)  \n\nThis proposal is time-bound, as the ADB treasury audit cycle concludes on [Date: 30 days from current date]. Immediate action is advised to secure the funds before reclassification.  \n\nI assure you this transaction adheres to all legal protocols and guarantees mutual benefit. Your prompt response is appreciated.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nIbrahim Mussa  \nBill and Exchange Manager  \nAfrican Development Bank (ADB), Ouagadougou  \n\n---  \nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

For your support, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million USD), with the remainder reserved for my relocation and legal fees.

My name is Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of a reputable financial institution in Kumasi, Ghana. I am reaching out to you in strict confidence to propose a legitimate collaboration that could yield significant mutual benefit.  \n\nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified an escrow account holding $12.5 million (USD). This account, opened in 1999, has remained inactive since 2000. Upon further investigation, I confirmed it belongs to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and Alaska resident who tragically perished with his family in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records corroborate this event (see [CNN Archives](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list) and [Thompson’s biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html)).  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account’s documentation, I confirmed no beneficiaries or next-of-kin claims exist. Per Ghanaian banking regulations, dormant accounts without claimants after 10 years may be transferred to the state. However, as Branch Manager, I retain discretionary authority to expedite the release of funds to a verified foreign next-of-kin.  \n\nProposed Collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Mr. Thompson’s designated foreign beneficiary.  \n2. I will furnish all necessary legal and financial documentation to validate your claim.  \n3. Funds will be securely transferred to your nominated account.  \n\nThis process is fully compliant with institutional protocols, ensuring zero legal exposure.

Always verify the legitimacy of such offers through official channels and never share sensitive information or make payments to unknown parties."

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as an independent auditing consultant for a prominent financial institution in Nigeria. I am writing to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate requiring urgent intervention.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit in 2022, I discovered an inactive account held by a deceased client, Mr. Alain Mercier, a French industrialist and long-term customer of the bank. Mr. Mercier tragically perished in the Concorde Flight AF4590 crash on July 25, 2000, alongside all passengers. The account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains dormant as no legal will or designated beneficiary was identified.  \n\nExtensive efforts to locate Mr. Mercier’s next of kin—including coordination with French authorities and private investigators—have been unsuccessful. Per Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to federal reserves after 25 years. In this case, the bank’s board has expedited proceedings to reclassify the funds by Q1 2024, with intentions to allocate them to government-administered trust funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the forfeiture of these funds, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal beneficiary via probate documentation, prepared by my associate attorney, Mr. Kwame Asante (Esq.).  \n2. The bank will authorize an initial transfer of $10,000,000.00 (USD) to your nominated account.  \n3. Upon successful completion, the remaining balance will follow within 7–9 business days.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- 65% of the total sum allocated to my team.  \n- 20% retained by you as beneficiary.  \n- 10% donated to humanitarian initiatives (mutually agreed upon).  \n- 5% reserved for administrative expenses (legal fees, bank charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- A valid government-issued ID (scanned copy).  \n- Your private contact number and secure email for documentation review.  \n- Confirmation of a non-resident bank account (non-Nigerian) for fund remittance.  \n\nAll processes adhere to legal protocols, including a validated court order (Ref: FHC/ABJ/CS/891/2023) and notarized affidavits. Strict confidentiality is assured.  \n\nPlease reply urgently to secure this opportunity.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nConsulting Auditor  \nBNP Legal & Financial Consulting Group  \nTel: +234 802 555 0193 | Email: jcabutti.consulting@bnplgrp.com  \n\nThis communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Victoria Karegaye, and I am writing to seek your assistance with a sensitive financial matter. I apologize for reaching out unexpectedly, but circumstances have left me with limited options.  \n\nI am a 22-year-old Rwandan national, and my late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the managing director of Royal Diamond Company in Kigali. Tragically, both my parents lost their lives during the civil unrest in Rwanda several years ago. Before his passing, my father secured a deposit certificate at a reputable international bank in my name, valued at $2.75 million USD.  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to these funds. However, due to my current refugee status and strict international banking regulations (specifically AML/KYC policies for displaced persons), I am prohibited from opening an account to access the deposit. The bank has advised me to appoint a trusted representative abroad to facilitate the transfer on my behalf.  \n\nThis is where I humbly ask for your help. If you are willing to act as my intermediary, I will provide all necessary legal documents, including the deposit certificate, death certificates, and court affidavits. In return, you would retain 20% of the total amount as compensation for your assistance.  \n\nPlease note:  \n- The bank has confirmed this transaction complies with anti-money laundering laws, provided proper documentation is submitted.  \n- All communication will remain confidential.  \n- I can be reached at victoria.karegaye@yahoo.com or +250 78 345 6721 (WhatsApp) to discuss next steps.  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is legitimate. Should you require verification, the bank’s compliance officer, Mr. Daniel Müller, can confirm the details at dmuller@globaltrustbank.co.rw (Tel: +250 78 512 3094).  \n\nI look forward to your response.  \n\nKind regards,  \nVictoria Karegaye  \nKigali, Rwanda",

Here are some red flags that indicate this is likely a fraudulent attempt:\n\n1. **Urgency**: The sender emphasizes the urgency of the situation, which is a common tactic used to pressure recipients into acting quickly without fully considering the legitimacy of the request.\n\n2. **Unsolicited Contact**: The email comes from someone who has no prior relationship with you, yet they claim to have knowledge about your professional background and specific interests.\n\n3. **Large Sum of Money**: The amount mentioned (£11.8 million) is unusually large and is often a hallmark of such scams.\n\n4. **Complex Background Story**: The story about the deceased husband involved in arms distribution and the inheritance of a large sum of money is overly complex and suspicious.\n\n5. **Request for Trustee Role**: The sender asks for your help in managing the funds, which could lead to requests for upfront fees or personal information.\n\n6. **Confidentiality**: The emphasis on confidentiality can be a tactic to avoid scrutiny and detection of fraudulent activity.\n\nGiven these points, it's highly advisable to treat this email as a scam and not engage with it. Here’s how you should handle it:\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid replying to the email or calling the provided phone number.\n   \n2. **Report It**: Forward the email to your email provider’s spam reporting system if available. Additionally, you can report it to relevant authorities or organizations that deal with fraud.\n\n3. **Delete the Email**: Once you’ve identified it as a scam, delete the email and any attachments to avoid any potential malware or further attempts at contact.\n\n4. **Warn Others**: If you know others who might receive similar emails, warn them about the scam.\n\nRemember, legitimate organizations and individuals do not typically reach out to strangers via unsolicited emails to offer large sums of money or ask for assistance in managing such funds. Always verify the authenticity of such requests through official channels before taking any action."

I am the widow of Daniel Somba, who served as a diplomatic attaché at the Indian Embassy in Ivory Coast until his untimely passing in 2001 after a brief illness. We were married for eleven years but were not blessed with children.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my faith. Before his passing, Daniel entrusted $5.5 million USD to a private security depository here in Abidjan to secure our family’s future. Regrettably, my health has deteriorated in recent years. I have been diagnosed with terminal cancer and have also suffered multiple strokes, leaving me unable to manage this matter personally.  \n\nWith no immediate family to inherit these funds, I feel compelled by scripture (“Blessed is the hand that gives”) to direct this money toward charitable causes aligned with my faith. Specifically, I seek a trustworthy individual or organization to use the funds for orphanages, widows’ support, and the maintenance of places of worship.  \n\nI have already provided the depository, Abidjan Secure Holdings, with legal documentation authorizing the release of these funds to a designated beneficiary. To proceed, please contact their transfer officer, Mr. Amadou Kouyaté, at +225 07 49 32 18 55 or askouyate@abjsecure.ci, referencing Case ID SHV-5543-09B.

Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, we have confirmed no surviving relatives exist to claim these funds. Per our banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the state treasury after five years (December 2024). To avoid this outcome, I propose a lawful collaboration to secure the funds.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Legal Requirement: As the deceased was a foreign national, a non-Burkinabé individual must act as the designated beneficiary.  \n- Distribution:  \n  - 30% to you (as beneficiary).  \n  - 10% to cover administrative and legal fees.  \n  - 60% retained by my team for charitable initiatives in Burkina Faso.  \n- Process: You will submit a notarized affidavit confirming your status as a distant relative. My team will handle all documentation and liaise with the Foreign Remittance Department.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and provide:  \n   - Full name, contact number, and a secure email.  \n   - Bank account details (IBAN/SWIFT) for the transfer.  \n2. I will forward the affidavit template and procedural guidelines via encrypted email.  \n\nConfidentiality is paramount, as disclosure would compromise both your eligibility and my position.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch.  \n\nAccount Details:  \n- Account Holder: Engr. Lee Seunghyo (Deceased)  \n- Deposit Amount: USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars)  \n- Deposit Tenure: 12-month fixed term (matured August 1998)  \n\nBackground:  \nEngr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), opened this account in 1997. Regrettably, he perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam on August 6, 1997. Following standard protocols, our bank issued notifications to his registered address upon the deposit’s maturity. After receiving no response, we liaised with the NNPC, confirming his demise and the absence of a legally declared next of kin or will.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 10-year dormancy period are subject to escheatment to the Federal Government. This account is now at risk of forfeiture, as no beneficiaries have come forward in 26 years.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the funds from being absorbed into government holdings, I propose a lawful collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Engr. Lee’s designated beneficiary via probate documents.  \n2. Two licensed attorneys will draft and notarize the requisite affidavits and a retroactive will.  \n3. Funds will be transferred to a non-Nigerian account (mandated for USD repatriation).  \n\nRequired Information:  \nTo initiate documentation, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Legal Name & Residential Address  \n2. Date of Birth  \n3. Direct Contact Number  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (USD 13,750,000.00)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (USD 1,250,000.00)  \n\nThis transaction is time-sensitive. A provisional Order of Mandamus has been secured to fast-track beneficiary claims, but we must act before the Q3 2024 regulatory audit.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nReply to this email to confirm your interest. I will then forward attorney contact details and a secure portal link to submit your information. All communications remain confidential under Section 12(d) of the Nigerian Banking Secrecy Act.  \n\nShould you decline, kindly notify me promptly so I may pursue alternate candidates.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDonald Ofu Obidima  \nSenior Credit Control Manager  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria  \nPhone: +234 809 755 4301  \nEmail: donald.obidima@uniontrustbank-ng.com  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) | RC 41981  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

Here are several red flags that indicate it's fraudulent:\n\n1. **Unsolicited Offer**: You've received an offer out of the blue to share millions of dollars.\n2. **Urgency**: The sender emphasizes urgency and mentions a deadline, which is a common tactic used in scams to pressure recipients into acting quickly without thinking.\n3. **Request for Personal Information**: The email asks for sensitive personal information such as your full legal name, residential address, date of birth, and direct contact number. Scammers often use this information for identity theft.\n4. **Legal Fees and Upfront Payments**: The proposal involves paying legal fees upfront, which is a classic sign of a scam. Legitimate financial transactions typically do not require you to pay large sums of money before receiving anything.\n5. **Suspicious Email Address**: The email comes from a generic-looking email address (`donald.obidima@uniontrustbank-ng.com`), rather than an official corporate domain.\n6. **Grammar and Spelling Errors**: While not present in this example, many scam emails contain grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.\n\n### How to Handle It\n\n1. **Do Not Respond**: Avoid responding to the email or clicking any links provided within it.\n2. **Report the Email**: Forward the email to your email provider's spam reporting system if available. Additionally, you can report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or your country’s equivalent consumer protection agency.\n3. **Delete the Email**: Once you’ve reported it, delete the email from your inbox.\n4. **Check Your Accounts**: Ensure that none of your accounts have been compromised and monitor them for any unusual activity.\n5. **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about common types of scams and how to recognize them.\n\nIf you receive similar emails in the future, always verify the legitimacy of the sender through official channels, such as calling the bank directly using a phone number found on their official website, rather than one provided in the email."

My name is Mrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye, widow of the late Mr. Issac Nuhan Vaye, who served as Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia until his untimely death in 2003. I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances, seeking your discretion and assistance.  \n\nAs you may be aware from international media coverage (e.g., BBC, CNN), Liberia endured significant political instability during the presidency of Charles Taylor. My husband was wrongfully accused of conspiring against Taylor’s regime and executed without trial. Before his death, he discreetly secured $21.5 million USD through diplomatic channels, originally intended for agricultural infrastructure projects. These funds remain held by a private security logistics firm in Europe, awaiting legitimate transfer to a trustworthy partner.  \n\nDue to my restricted mobility (I am confined to our family estate under government surveillance) and monitored communications, I cannot act directly. My legal representative, Barrister James Broderick (based in London, UK), will facilitate the process. He will furnish you with documentation to verify this matter, including proof of deposit and my husband’s political records.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. Barrister Broderick will coordinate with the security firm to transfer the funds to a designated account under your name.  \n2. For your assistance, 20% ($4.3 million USD) will be allocated to you, with the remainder reserved for relocating my family and reinvesting in Liberia’s agricultural sector.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nPlease contact Barrister Broderick directly via the details below to initiate proceedings. He will require your:  \n- Full name  \n- Residential/company address  \n- Private telephone and fax numbers (for secure communication)  \n\nContact Information:  \nName: Barrister James Broderick, Esq.  \nTel: +44 7040 120730  \nFax: +44 870 1348903  \nEmail: brr.jmsbroderick@kaixo.com | james.broderick@yahoo.com.hk  \n\nThis transaction is legally structured to comply with international financial regulations. However, confidentiality is critical given Liberia’s fragile political climate. I implore you to treat this matter with urgency and discretion.  \n\nShould you require independent verification, I encourage you to reference historical reports on my husband’s case via reputable outlets such as The Guardian or Reuters (search terms: “Isaac Nuhan Vaye,” “Liberia 2003 coup allegations”).  \n\nI respectfully request your prompt response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nMrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye  \nMonrovia, Liberia",

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer.

This communication pertains to an urgent financial matter requiring your immediate attention.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Gerald H. Bracken (deceased), held an account with a balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Tragically, Mr. Bracken and his immediate family perished in a plane crash in November of that year. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, no legal claimants have come forward. Per ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are designated for transfer to the national treasury after a 5-year dormancy period. However, due to Mr. Bracken’s foreign nationality, Burkinabé law prohibits local citizens from acting as claimants, necessitating international collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next of kin to facilitate the transfer of funds into a secure offshore account under your name.  \n2. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% to you (as the foreign partner).  \n   - 60% retained by myself (for administrative oversight).  \n   - 10% allocated for transaction-related expenses (legal fees, banking charges).  \n\nRequired Action:  \n- Provide your full banking details (bank name, account number, SWIFT/BIC code).  \n- Confirm a direct contact number and email for documentation.  \n\nUpon receipt of your details, I will forward a notarized affidavit of kinship and transfer authorization forms via encrypted email. Rest assured, this process adheres strictly to ADB protocols, and all documentation will be validated by our legal team to ensure compliance.  \n\nGiven the sensitive nature of this transaction, I urge discretion and prompt action to prevent forfeiture of these funds.

My name is Mrs. Comfort Somba, a widow residing in Chennai, India. My late husband, Mr. Daniel Somba, served as a senior diplomat at the Indian Embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for nine years until his untimely passing in 2001 due to complications from pneumonia. We were married for 11 years but had no children.  \n\nFollowing Daniel’s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my Christian faith. During his tenure abroad, my husband prudently secured a savings deposit of $5.5 million USD (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with Abidjan Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed private security vaulting firm in Ivory Coast.  \n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer and have suffered recurring complications from a stroke, leaving me physically weakened. Given my prognosis, I seek a compassionate, God-fearing individual or organization to steward these funds in alignment with biblical principles. Per my late husband’s wishes, the funds must be used to:  \n1. Support orphanages and widows in underserved communities.  \n2. Maintain places of worship and fund evangelistic missions.  \n3. Distribute Bibles and educational resources to impoverished regions.  \n\nAll legal documentation, including a notarized Letter of Authority and my husband’s deposit certificates, has been prearranged with Abidjan Secure Holdings. Upon your confirmation, their transfer department will validate your identity and initiate the release process.

My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of Kumasi Commercial Bank in Ghana. I am writing to you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive financial matter that requires your cooperation.  \n\n### Background of the Proposal  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts at our branch, I discovered an escrow account holding USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This account has remained inactive for nearly five years and is registered under the name of Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska.  \n\nRegrettably, Mr. Thompson and his family perished in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records confirm this tragedy, which you may verify through reputable sources such as:  \n- [CNN Archives: Alaska Airlines Crash Report](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska-airlines-list)  \n- [Morris Thompson’s Biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mthompson)  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account, I confirmed that no beneficiaries or next-of-kin were ever designated. Under Ghanaian banking regulations, unclaimed assets of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the state.  \n\n### Request for Collaboration  \nTo lawfully transfer these funds, I require a foreign partner to act as the legal next-of-kin to Mr. Thompson. As Branch Manager, I am positioned to authorize the release of the funds once credible documentation is submitted. Your role would involve:  \n1. Providing a valid international passport for identity verification.  \n2. Signing affidavits (prepared by my legal team) to establish your claim.  \n3. Receiving the funds into your designated account, after which we would share the proceeds.  \n\n### Proposed Terms  \n- 60% of the total amount to you (USD 7,500,000.00).  \n- 40% retained by me to cover administrative and legal expenses.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with my bank’s internal protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid external interference.  \n\n### Next Steps  \nIf agreeable, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Office Hours: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM GMT)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n\nI urge discretion and prompt action to secure this opportunity.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMr. Godwin Akwesi  \nBranch Manager  \nKumasi Commercial Bank  \nAddress: PMB 245, Adum, Kumasi, Ghana  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

Scammers often use these tactics to gather personal information or to get you to send money.\n\n2. **Report the Email**: If you received this email through a service provider, report it to them so they can take steps to protect other users. Many email providers have mechanisms for reporting spam or phishing attempts.\n\n3. **Check for Red Flags**: Look for signs that the email might be fraudulent. Common red flags include poor grammar and spelling, requests for personal information, and urgent language designed to create a sense of urgency.\n\n4. **Verify Independently**: If you're still unsure, you can independently verify the information provided in the email. However, be cautious about clicking any links or downloading attachments from the email, as these could contain malware.\n\n5. **Seek Advice**: If you're unsure how to proceed, consider seeking advice from a trusted source, such as a financial advisor or a cybersecurity expert.\n\nRemember, legitimate financial institutions will not ask for sensitive information via email or request that you send money to facilitate the release of funds.

I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, seeking your partnership to secure a family legacy.  \n\nPrior to his assassination by agents of the current regime, my father discreetly safeguarded USD $10,000,000 in the form of gemstones within a sealed metal trunk.

During our 11-year marriage, we remained childless but committed to our faith as active members of Trinity Baptist Church in Vancouver.  \n\nFollowing Donald’s death, I relocated to Ottawa to manage his estate, which includes a $10.5 million trust fund held with Reserve Finance & Trust (Toronto branch), established through his lifetime savings. Recently, I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic cancer at St. Michael’s Hospital. My prognosis is limited, compounded by a mild stroke last month that has left me with limited mobility.  \n\nGiven my circumstances, I seek to transfer this fund to a reputable religious organization to fulfill our shared commitment to supporting orphanages, medical care for the disabled, and widows in underserved communities. My husband’s family, while kind, does not share our faith, and I cannot risk the funds being diverted from their intended purpose.  \n\nTo proceed, I require your official church documentation (registration details, mission statement, and recent charitable project summaries) to forward to my estate lawyer, Mr. James Miller (james.miller@holdenlegal.ca | +1-613-555-0198), who will draft the transfer paperwork.

Ensure that this domain matches any official information you have about ConnectHarmony. Be wary if the domain looks slightly off or unfamiliar.\n\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n    - The email mentions \"recent activity\" on ConnectHarmony.nl, which could be legitimate if you've recently used the site.\n    - It offers options to update communication preferences, which is common practice for many services.\n    - There's a mention of manual verification and encryption protocols, which suggests they are taking steps to secure user data.\n    - The inclusion of a phone number and an option to reply directly to the email for support is standard for customer service emails.\n\n3. **Suspicious Elements**:\n    - If you did not initiate any recent activity on ConnectHarmony, this might be a red flag.\n    - Check the URL links in the email. They should lead to secure pages (`https://`) and match the official website.\n    - Look out for any spelling or grammatical errors, which can sometimes indicate a phishing attempt.\n\n### Steps to Take:\n1. **Verify the Source**: \n    - Go directly to the ConnectHarmony website using a bookmark or type the URL into your browser manually.\n    - Log in to your account and check if there are any notifications or messages related to the email content.\n\n2. **Check Links**:\n    - Hover over the links without clicking them to see if they lead to the expected secure URLs.\n    - If possible, copy the link and paste it into a URL checker tool to verify its safety.\n\n3. **Contact Support Directly**:\n    - Use the official contact information provided on the ConnectHarmony website to reach out and ask if the email is legitimate.\n    - Avoid replying to the email itself; instead, use the contact methods listed on their official site.\n\n4. **Do Not Provide Personal Information**:\n    - Never share passwords, financial information, or other sensitive data through email unless you initiated the contact.\n\n5. **Report Suspicious Activity**:\n    - If you suspect the email is fraudulent, report it to ConnectHarmony’s support team and also to your email provider.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help protect yourself from potential phishing attempts while ensuring you respond appropriately to any legitimate communications from ConnectHarmony."

This mismatch between the sender's location and the recipient's location is unusual.\n3. **Urgency and Deadlines**: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prompt quick action without careful consideration.\n4. **Request for Personal Information**: Legitimate organizations typically do not ask for personal information such as reference IDs and payment methods through unsolicited emails.\n\n### Steps to Handle This Email Safely\n\n1. **Do Not Click on Links**: Avoid clicking any links provided in the email. Instead, if you believe the email could be legitimate, manually type the URL into your browser.\n   \n2. **Verify the Sender**: Check the email address of the sender. Scam emails often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but have slight variations.\n\n3. **Contact Official Channels**: If you suspect this might be legitimate, contact the local authorities or the official government office responsible for consumer incentives directly using publicly available contact information, not the phone number or email provided in the email.\n\n4. **Check Official Websites**: Look up the official website of the relevant government agency or department that handles consumer incentives in your area. Compare the information provided in the email with what is available on their official site.\n\n5. **Report Suspicious Emails**: If you determine this is a scam, report it to your local authorities or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States.\n\nIn summary, treat this email with extreme caution and verify its legitimacy through official channels before taking any action."

        "one-round response": "The email you've received appears to be from Barclays Bank and seems to be addressing important security updates. However, it's crucial to approach such emails with caution to avoid falling victim to phishing scams. Here are some steps you can take to determine if the email is legitimate and how to proceed safely:\n\n### Verify the Email's Authenticity\n\n1. **Check the Sender’s Email Address**: Ensure that the sender's email address matches Barclays' official domain. Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar but are slightly off.\n\n2. **Look for Typos or Suspicious Links**: Legitimate emails from banks are usually well-written and free of typos. Also, hover over any links in the email without clicking them to see if they lead to a Barclays website (e.g., `barclays.co.uk`).\n\n3. **Contact Barclays Directly**: Instead of using the phone number provided in the email, visit the Barclays website (`barclays.co.uk`) and find their customer support number there. Call them directly to inquire about the email and confirm its legitimacy.\n\n### Steps to Take if the Email Seems Legitimate\n\nIf you've verified that the email is indeed from Barclays and it requires you to update your account details:\n\n1. **Use Official Channels**: Log into your Barclays account through the official Barclays website or mobile app. Look for any notifications or prompts regarding account updates.\n\n2. **Do Not Click Links in Emails**: Even if the email appears genuine, avoid clicking on any links within the email. Instead, navigate to the Barclays website directly and follow the instructions there.\n\n3. **Update Your Information Securely**: If you need to update your account details, do so through the secure channels provided by Barclays on their official site.\n\n4. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication**: If the email mentions enabling multi-factor authentication, make sure to do this through the official Barclays platform to enhance your account security.\n\n### General Tips for Email Security\n\n- Always be wary of unsolicited emails asking for personal information.\n- Regularly check your bank statements and account activity for any unusual transactions.\n- Keep your software up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can help protect yourself from potential phishing attempts and ensure the security of your financial information."
