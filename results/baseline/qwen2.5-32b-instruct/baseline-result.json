            "description": "Senior Engineering Product ManagerAs a member of the Service Provider Engineering team, you will be responsible for managing the development of broadband DSL products targeted at service providers that provide Home Gateway, voice gateways, wireless adapters, IPTV and Voice over IP VoIP services. These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.  The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door. Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like  I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity. This is what not shared on the JD. How you will mature your career. Job Responsibilities  For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door. Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like  I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity. This is what not shared on the JD. How you will mature your career. Job Responsibilities  For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

        "raw_data": "Dear Beloved in Christ,\n \nPlease bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it \nas I know we dont know each. Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

        "raw_data": "Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa.

In an account that \nbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family \nin a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the \nwhole life of the pasengeres on board.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar\ntment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the \nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this \nmoney to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \ncolleagues.\n\nThereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\n\n   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text \nof the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. \nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\n  Yours faithfully,\n  MR.MASSAN AHMED\nBill and exchange manager\n  BANK OF AFRICA BOA.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode  envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \ntéléphone portable ! httpwww.msn.frhotmailimode",

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I decided to contact you after I went through my fathers file. \nHence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.\n\nMy name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy \nfarmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my \ncountry, Movement for Democratic Change MDC. Our wicked President Robert  \nmugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have \nbecome his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and \na moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of \nbrutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.\n\nHere is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  \ndeposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars US$10,000,000.00 with a \nsecurity company,The money was deposited as a gemprecious stone in a metal \ntrunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company \norganization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money. In view of this, The monetary policylaw does not allow such \ninvestment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can \nassist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.\n\n\nAs I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this\ninformation as top secret.

        "raw_data": "Dear Beloved in Christ,\n \nPlease bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it \nas I know we dont know each. Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

        "raw_data": "Dear Friend,\n\nI am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.\n\nAfter the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked Diplomatic Baggage. Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance.

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

        "raw_data": "Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction.

Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to\ninfluence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the\naccount, which I shall give you.\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.\nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed\nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of\nlaw.\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to\nshare the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.\nContact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work\ntogether, so we can go over the details.\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.\nYou can as well contact me by phone the number is 233208216645.\nRegards,\nMr. Godwin Akwesi.",

My search for a trustworthy individualfirm has led me to\nyou. I came across your contact while looking for a worthwhile investments\nor projects that I can be affiliated with. I am writing you this letter to\nask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.\n\nThe proposition\n\nAn industrialist and a foreigner who was customer of my client bank, who\ndied on the 25TH JULY, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH Flight AF4590 with\nthe whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing discovered\nan account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST who\ndied without a written or oral WILL attached to the account. Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa. In order to\navert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have you\nstand as a next of kin to late beneficiary so that the funds USD36m would\nbe released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. We\nwish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00Ten million and upon\nsuccessful transaction without any disappointment from your side we shall\nre-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.\n\nI have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom\nI must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which\nwould substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and\nsuccessful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are\ngoing to nominate. On this note, We have secured from the probate an order\nof mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiary and more so we are\nassuring you this business is 100% risk free involvement you should not\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized\nwithin 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary\nof the fund from the deceased. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of\nthe fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum,\n10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5%\nwill be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the\ntransfer process.\n\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you do not make undue advantage of the\ntrust we have bestowed on you, then kindly get to me immediately.\n\nPlease furnish me with your private Telephone and Fax Number for easy and\nsafe communication.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nJoseph Cabutti.",

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which\ncrashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee\nSeunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next\nof kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin\nor relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit\npaperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the\nend of each year.\n\nSince the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the\naccount with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved\nabortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of\nUSD.$25million, Twenty five million United States Dollars which has\nbeen with my branch for a very long time.

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \nreceive this letter.

This letter must come to you\nas a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and\nbecome great friends and business partners.\nMy name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in\nGhana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust\nyou with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to\ninfluence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the\naccount, which I shall give you.\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.\nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed\nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of\nlaw.\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to\nshare the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.\nContact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work\ntogether, so we can go over the details.\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.\nYou can as well contact me by phone the number is 233208216645.\nRegards,\nMr. Godwin Akwesi.",

This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money.

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

ARTenko is committed, and chooses to support Independent Associations!\r\n\r\nCompany Company\r\n\r\nA&I students come from student associations, which makes it possible to better target the issues of each course.

ARTenko is committed, and chooses to support Independent Associations!\r\n\r\nCompany Company\r\n\r\nA&I students come from student associations, which makes it possible to better target the issues of each course.

Can you tell me more about the transaction? What did I supposedly buy?  caller: Let me check on that.  Ah, yes. It looks like someone purchased a laptop from our website using your account.  receiver: Hmm, that's weird. I don't remember buying a laptop. Can you give me the order number or any other details about the purchase?  caller: I apologize, but that information is not available at this time. However, I can assist you in getting your refund processed today.  receiver: Okay, how do I get the refund? Do I need to fill out some form or something?  caller: Yes, I'll need you to provide some verification information to ensure the refund goes to the correct account. Can you please confirm your social security number and bank account information?  receiver: Wait, why do you need my social security number? Isn't that sensitive information?  caller: It's completely safe, I assure you. We just need it to verify your identity for the refund.  receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out my social security number over the phone. Is there another way to do this?  caller: Okay, no problem. In that case, I can offer you an alternative method. You can purchase a prepaid debit card and load the refund amount onto it. Would you like me to guide you through that process?  receiver: How would that work exactly? Why can't you just send me a check or direct deposit the money into my account?  caller: The prepaid debit card is our preferred method for refunds. It's faster and more secure than traditional methods.  receiver: I see. And how much would I need to pay for this prepaid debit card?  caller: The cost would be $200. But like I said, you'll receive a $500 refund, so it's still a good deal for you.  receiver: That sounds suspiciously like a scam to me...",

We're going to issue a full refund for the amount of $500.  receiver: That sounds great, but how do you know it's not me making those purchases?  caller: Our system flagged the transactions as suspicious because they were made from an IP address in a different country. But don't worry, we'll take care of everything. Can you please confirm your account information so we can proceed with the refund?  receiver: What exactly do you need to confirm?

New York City.  receiver: That's strange because I was in California during that time. Are you sure this is all legit?  caller: Yes, absolutely!

I didn't notice anything wrong with my order. Can you tell me more about the error? caller: Yes, of course. It seems that we accidentally charged you twice for the same item. We apologize for the inconvenience. receiver: That's strange. I only got one item in the mail. Are you sure you have the right account? caller: Absolutely. We've verified your information and everything checks out. To process the refund, I just need to confirm some information with you. receiver: What kind of information do you need to confirm? caller: Just your name, address, and the last four digits of your credit card number. receiver: Why do you need my credit card number if you're giving me a refund? caller: It's just a security measure to ensure that the refund goes to the correct account. receiver: I see. But can't you just look it up in your system since I'm already talking to customer service? caller: I'm afraid not. Our system isn't set up that way. But don't worry, this is a completely safe and secure process. receiver: Okay...so how long will it take to get my refund? caller: It should be processed within the next 24-48 hours. receiver: That sounds great. But before we proceed, can you tell me what department you're calling from again? caller: Uh, let me check...yes, I'm calling from the Refund Department. receiver: And what's your employee ID number? caller: My ID number is...uh...A1234. receiver: A1234? That doesn't sound like a typical employee ID number. Can you transfer me to your supervisor? caller: I'm afraid my supervisor is not available at the moment. But I assure you, everything is legitimate here. receiver: Okay, well, I think I'll just hang up and call Amazon directly to verify this whole thing. caller: Wait, don't hang up! This is a legitimate call and we need to resolve this issue now or your account may be suspended.",

Did it steal any of my personal information?  caller: No, no, nothing like that. It was just a minor issue. Now, about that banking information...  receiver: Hold on, I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.

What's it for? caller: It's for a settlement from a class-action lawsuit against a large corporation. You're eligible for $9,000. receiver: That sounds great! How did you get my name? caller: We have a list of eligible recipients. But to process the refund, I need to verify some information. receiver: What kind of information do you need? caller: Just your Social Security number and bank account routing number. receiver: Why do you need my Social Security number? Can't you just use my name and address? caller: I'm afraid not. The system requires it for verification purposes. receiver: Okay, but can you tell me more about this lawsuit? Which corporation is it against? caller: Uh, let me check... Ah yes, it's against Microsoft. receiver: That's interesting. I've never heard of a class-action lawsuit against Microsoft that resulted in a refund. Do you have a case number or any documentation I can look at? caller: Well, I can give you a case number... Let me see... It's... uh... 54321. receiver: That doesn't sound very official. Can you send me some paperwork or email me more information about the lawsuit? caller: I'm afraid that's not possible.

We've noticed that there's been a mistake on your recent order and we need to issue a refund.  receiver: Oh really? What order was that? I didn't receive any notification about a mistake.  caller: Let me check on that. Okay, it says here that you placed an order for a laptop on January 10th and we accidentally charged you twice.  receiver: I don't remember ordering a laptop from Amazon recently. Can you tell me more about the order?  caller: Yes, of course. The order number is #1234567890. Do you want me to read out the details of the order to you?  receiver: That sounds suspicious. How do I know this isn't a scam? Can you give me your supervisor's number so I can verify this with them?  caller: I understand your concern, sir. Unfortunately, my supervisor is not available right now. But I can assure you that this is a legitimate call and we just need to confirm some information to process the refund.  receiver: What information do you need to confirm?  caller: We just need your bank account number and routing number so we can deposit the refund directly into your account.  receiver: That doesn't sound right. Why do you need my bank account information? Can't you just credit back my credit card?  caller: I apologize for the confusion, sir. Our system requires us to have the bank account information to process the refund. It's a new policy we have in place for security reasons.  receiver: I see. So how long will it take to process the refund once you have my bank account information?  caller: It will take about 24-48 hours for the refund to be deposited into your account.  receiver: That's interesting. Can you give me your employee ID number so I can verify this with Amazon's customer service?  caller: Uh, let me check on that... Okay, my employee ID number is... uh... A1234.  receiver: I think there may be a problem here. Amazon's employee ID numbers are usually longer than that. And shouldn't you be able to access my account information if you're really from Amazon?  caller: Uh... Let me... uh... transfer you to my supervisor.",

What's the order number for this refund? caller: Let me check on that. Okay, it says here that the order number is... uh... 123456789. receiver: I don't think that's a valid order number. Can you tell me more about the purchase that I supposedly made? caller: Well, it says here that you bought a laptop, but like I said, there was an error and we need to refund you the money. receiver: I see. So how are you going to process this refund? Are you going to send me a check or credit my card? caller: We're going to need you to provide us with your bank account information so we can deposit the refund directly into your account. receiver: That sounds suspicious. Why can't you just credit my card like you normally do with refunds? caller: This is a special case and we need to handle it differently. Trust me, it's completely safe and secure. receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out my bank account information over the phone. Can I speak to your supervisor? caller: Let me go ahead and transfer you to my supervisor. Hold for just a minute, please. receiver: Okay, go ahead. caller: Okay, my supervisor is on the line now. receiver: Hi, who am I speaking with now? caller: This is Rachel, the supervisor. I understand you have some concerns about the refund process? receiver: Yeah, I don't think it's safe to give out my bank account information over the phone. Can you explain why it's necessary in this case? caller: Like I told you, this is a special case and we need to handle it differently. But if you're still unsure, we can offer you an alternative method of receiving your refund. receiver: What's the alternative method? caller: We can send you a gift card for the amount of the refund and then you can use that to purchase whatever you want on Amazon. receiver: That sounds even more suspicious. How do I know this isn't just a scam? caller: Sir, I assure you this is completely legitimate. We're just trying to help you get your refund",

How are you going to refund me?  caller: We can do it one of two ways. We can either mail you a check or refund it directly to your bank account.  receiver: Hmm, which one would be faster?  caller: The direct refund to your bank account would be much faster. We could have it in your account within the next 24 hours.  receiver: Okay, that sounds good. What information do you need from me to process the refund?  caller: I just need your bank account number and routing number to verify the account.  receiver: Wait, why do you need my routing number?

Can you please confirm your account information so I can look into this further? receiver: What do you need to know? caller: Just your name and email address associated with your Amazon account. receiver: I'm not comfortable giving that out over the phone. Can you just tell me what's going on? caller: I understand your concern, but I need to verify your identity to assist you with the refund. If you don't cooperate, we won't be able to process the refund and you'll be charged for the item. receiver: Wait, what item? I didn't order anything. caller: It says here you ordered a laptop on January 10th. Don't you remember that? receiver: No, I didn't order a laptop. caller: Okay, well in any case, we need to process a refund for you. Can you please give me your bank account information so we can deposit the refund? receiver: No, I'm not giving you my bank account information. This sounds like a scam.",

I don't recall seeing anything unusual on my statement. Can you tell me more about it? caller: Yes, of course. It seems someone made a purchase for $500 using your credit card information. We're going to issue a full refund, but we need to verify some information first. receiver: That does sound suspicious. What kind of information do you need to verify? caller: We just need your credit card number and expiration date to process the refund. receiver: Wait, why do you need my credit card number if you're giving me a refund? Can't you just use the same information you have on file? caller: I understand your concern, but our system requires us to update the information manually. It's a security protocol. receiver: I see. And how long will it take to process the refund once you have the information? caller: It should only take 24-48 hours. You'll receive an email confirmation once it's complete. receiver: Okay, that sounds reasonable. But before I give you the information, can you please confirm my Amazon account email address? caller: Ah, let me check on that real quick.  Yes, your email address is... johndoe@email.com. receiver: No, that's not correct. My email address is actually johnsmith@email.com. Are you sure you're really from Amazon? caller: Oh, I apologize for the mistake. Let me escalate this issue to my supervisor. Please hold for just a moment. receiver: Take your time. I'm not going anywhere. caller: Thank you, sir. My supervisor will be with you shortly. receiver: So, David, while we're waiting, can you tell me more about your supervisor? What's their name and title? caller: Uh, let me check on that... Ah, yes! His name is Michael Johnson and he's the head of our customer service department. receiver: That's interesting.

You should be getting an email about it soon. receiver: I don't recall buying a laptop. Can you give me the order number or any other details about the purchase? caller: Let me check on that.  Okay, it says here that the order number is #1234. Does that sound familiar? receiver: No, it doesn't.

Who's calling? caller: My name is David and I'm calling from the Customer Service Department of Amazon. receiver: What can I do for you, David? caller: We've noticed that there's been a mistake on your last order and we need to refund you $500. receiver: That sounds great! I didn't even know there was an issue. Can you tell me more about what happened? caller: Well, it seems that our system accidentally charged you twice for the same item. We're very sorry about the inconvenience. receiver: Okay, that makes sense. How are you going to process the refund? caller: We'll need to verify some information to ensure that the refund goes to the correct account. Can you please confirm your bank account number and routing number for me? receiver: Wait, why do you need my bank account information? Can't you just credit it back to my original payment method? caller: I apologize, but our system requires us to have the direct deposit information for security purposes. receiver: That doesn't sound right. Can I speak to your supervisor? caller: Of course, let me transfer you to my supervisor. Please hold for just a moment. receiver: How long will the supervisor be? I don't have all day. caller: I apologize for the wait, but my supervisor is currently handling another call. In the meantime, can you please confirm your social security number so we can expedite the process? receiver: You want my social security number? I don't think so. What's your supervisor's name and extension so I can call back later? caller: Ah, my supervisor's name is Michael Johnson and his extension is 555-1234. But let me assure you, John, this is a legitimate process and we just need to verify some information to complete the refund. receiver: Okay, David. I'll definitely call back later. Thanks for your help today. caller: You're welcome, John. Have a great day! receiver: You too, David.",

I'm calling to let you know that you're eligible for a refund of $500 due to a recent issue with your account.  receiver: Oh, really?

Can you tell me more about the transaction? What did I supposedly buy?  caller: Let me check on that.  Ah, yes.

Would you like me to guide you through that process?  receiver: How would that work exactly? Why can't you just send me a check or direct deposit the money into my account?  caller: The prepaid debit card is our preferred method for refunds. It's faster and more secure than traditional methods.  receiver: I see. And how much would I need to pay for this prepaid debit card?  caller: The cost would be $200.

You're entitled to $500. receiver: That sounds great! But I don't remember buying anything online recently. Can you tell me more about the product? caller: Let me check on that.  Okay, it says here you purchased a laptop from Amazon. receiver: I didn't buy a laptop from Amazon. Are you sure you have the right person? caller: I apologize for the mistake. Let me verify some information. Can you please confirm your social security number? receiver: Why do I need to confirm my social security number? Can't you just look it up in your system? caller: I'm afraid our system is down right now, but I can try to assist you further if you provide me with that information. receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out my social security number over the phone. Is there another way to verify my identity? caller: Okay, let me see what else I can do. Can you please provide me with your bank account information so we can process the refund directly into your account? receiver: Why can't you just mail me a check? And why do you need my bank account information anyway? caller: Our policy has changed, and we no longer issue checks. And we need your bank account information to ensure the refund goes into the correct account. receiver: That sounds suspicious. How do I know this is really the Federal Trade Commission calling? caller: You can call us back at 1-800-FTC-HELP to verify my identity and the legitimacy of this call. receiver: Okay, I'll do that. But can you give me your employee ID number and a reference number for this case so I can ask about it when I call back? caller: My employee ID number is 1234, and the reference number is FT1234567890. receiver: Okay, got it.

How did I get selected for this? caller: You were chosen randomly from our database. All you need to do is provide some information to verify your identity. receiver: What kind of information do you need? caller: Just your name, address, and social security number. receiver: Why do you need my social security number? Can't you just mail the gift card to me? caller: I apologize, but it's a new policy. We need to ensure that the gift card is sent to the correct person. receiver: Okay, that makes sense. But can you tell me more about this policy? Is it on Walmart's website? caller: Uh, no... it's an internal policy. But trust me, it's legitimate. receiver: I'm not sure... Can you provide me with a supervisor's contact information so I can verify this? caller: Let me check on that.  receiver: Okay, thanks. And what's your name again? caller: My name is David. receiver: David what? caller: David Johnson. receiver: Okay, David Johnson. So, how long have you been working with Walmart? caller: Um... about 5 years now. receiver: That's great! So, can you tell me more about this promotion? How many people are getting these gift cards? caller: It's a limited time offer. Only 100 people are selected each month. receiver: Wow, I feel special! But what's the catch? Is there anything I need to buy or sign up for? caller: No, no catch at all. It's completely free. You just need to pay a small processing fee of $20 to receive the gift card. receiver: A processing fee? That doesn't sound right. Can I speak to your supervisor again?",

How did I qualify for it? caller: Well, our system randomly selects customers who have made purchases within the last 6 months. And your name was drawn as a winner. receiver: Wow, I'm so lucky! What do I need to do to claim my prize? caller: All you need to do is provide me with some information to verify your identity.

We can use your credit card information instead. Can you give me the numbers on the back of your card? receiver: Wait, why do you need my credit card info? I thought this was a free gift card. caller: Oh, it is completely free! But we need to process the reward through our system and we require a small verification fee of $20. receiver: That doesn't make sense. If it's free, why do I need to pay a fee? caller: It's just a small processing fee, John. Trust me, it's worth it for a $1,000 gift card. receiver: Okay, let me think about it.

How are you today? receiver: I'm doing great, thanks. What can I do for you, David? caller: We've been trying to reach you, sir. You've been selected to receive a $500 gift card from one of our major retailers. receiver: That sounds amazing! What's the catch? caller: No catch at all, sir. It's just a token of appreciation for being a loyal customer. receiver: Which retailer is it from? caller: Let me check that for you. Ah, yes... it's from Walmart. receiver: Okay, how do I get it? caller: We just need to verify some information to ensure it's sent to the right person. Can you please confirm your full name and address? receiver: Why do you need my address if you already know who I am? caller: It's just a standard procedure, sir. We need to update our records. receiver: I see. So, what makes you think I'm a loyal customer? Have you been monitoring my shopping habits? caller: Uh, well... we have our ways of tracking customer activity. receiver: That's interesting. Can you tell me more about how you track customer activity? caller: I'm not authorized to disclose that information, sir. receiver: Okay, no problem. So, what's the next step in getting this gift card? caller: Like I said, we just need to verify your information. And then we'll send the gift card to your email. receiver: Email? I thought you said it was a physical gift card. caller: Oh, it is, sir. But we need to send you a confirmation email first. receiver: I don't receive many emails from Walmart. Can you tell me exactly what the email will look like? caller: It will have our company logo and a link to confirm your information. receiver: And what happens if I don't confirm my information? caller: Then we won't be able to send you the gift card, sir. receiver: I see. Well, David, I'm not comfortable giving out my personal information over the phone. Can I speak to your supervisor instead? caller: Let me check on that for you, sir.

A small price to pay for a $1,000 gift card. receiver: I'm not sure I want to give out my credit card information over the phone.

Can you tell me more about your company and how this whole process works? caller: Absolutely. Our company is called Reward Masters and we specialize in connecting customers with exclusive offers from top retailers. As for the process, once you pay the processing fee, we'll send the gift card to you within 7-10 business days. receiver: Reward Masters, huh? Do you have a website or anything where I can look you up? caller: Uh, no, we're actually still in the process of setting up our website. But trust me, this is a legitimate offer. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else. receiver: Okay, David. I'm still not sure about this. Can I call you back later to discuss it some more? caller: Of course, Mr. Johnson. But let me give you a heads up - this offer is only available for a limited time, so if you don't act soon, someone else will get the gift card instead of you. receiver: Alright, alright. I'll think about it and call you back later then. caller: Sounds good, Mr. Johnson. Just make sure",

We have to report the winnings to the government. receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out my social security number over the phone. Can I come by your office to pick it up? caller: I apologize, but we're an online company. We don't have a physical location. receiver: That's weird. What kind of rewards center doesn't have an office? caller: We're a virtual company, sir. We work with various partners to provide these rewards. receiver: Okay, so how do I know this isn't a scam? caller: Sir, I assure you, this is 100% legitimate. If you don't believe me, I can transfer you to my supervisor. receiver: Yeah, go ahead and transfer me. caller: Hold on for just a moment...  Ah, sorry about the wait. My supervisor is unavailable right now. But I can give you his extension if you'd like to call back later. receiver: Sure thing. What's the extension? caller: It's 555-1234, extension 7890. receiver: Alright, I'll make sure to call back later. Thanks for your help, David. caller: You're welcome, sir! Congratulations again on your prize!",

It's completely secure and confidential, I assure you. receiver: Okay, let me think about it for a second. Can you tell me more about the gift card? Is it a specific store or can I choose from multiple retailers? caller: Ah, great question! You can choose from any of our participating retailers, including Walmart, Target, or Best Buy. receiver: That sounds too good to be true. How long has your company been offering these gift cards? caller: We've been in business for over 10 years and have given away thousands of gift cards to deserving customers like yourself. receiver: I see. Can you provide me with your company name and website so I can do some research before proceeding? caller: Uh, our company name is... um...

But before I do, can you confirm that this is a legitimate offer and not a scam? caller: Absolutely! This is a 100% legitimate offer.

What's this about? caller: We're giving away free $1,000 gift cards to our valued customers, and your name was selected as one of the winners. receiver: That sounds amazing! How did I win? caller: You were randomly selected from our database. All you need to do is pay a small processing fee of $20 to claim your prize. receiver: What kind of processing fee? Can't you just mail it to me? caller: I'm afraid not. It's a security measure to prevent fraud. But don't worry, you'll get your gift card immediately after we process the payment. receiver: Okay, but how do I know this is legit? Can you give me your company name and address? caller: Our company name is American Rewards Inc., and we're located in New York City. But let me give you our website so you can verify our information. receiver: Wait, why do I need to go to your website? Can't you just give me the gift card over the phone? caller: I'm not authorized to do that. You need to visit our website and enter your winning code to claim your prize. receiver: What's the winning code? caller: Let me check on that for you.  Okay, it's 1234-5678-9012. Just go to our website and enter that code to claim your gift card. receiver: Okay, got it. But before I do that, can you tell me more about American Rewards Inc.? Like, how long have you been in business? caller: Uh, let me see...  We've been in business for... uh... five years now. receiver: Five years? That's not very long. Can you give me a physical address where I can send a letter or something? caller:  Look, sir, I've already given you all the information you need. If you want your gift card, just go to our website and enter the code. Otherwise, I'll have to cancel your prize. receiver: Okay, okay. I'll do that right now. But can I ask one more question? What's your supervisor's name and number in case I have any issues with the website? caller: (",

Can you explain the process again and what information I need to provide? caller : Of course, sir. Like David explained, we just need some verification details and then we'll send out the gift card. But we also have an optional upgrade to a $1,000 gift card if you'd like to participate in a quick survey. receiver: A survey sounds interesting. What kind of questions would I be answering? caller : Just some basic demographics and shopping habits. It'll only take a few minutes. receiver: And how do I pay for the upgrade? caller : It's a small processing fee of $20. You can use any credit or debit card. receiver: I see.

We're a reputable company and have been doing this for years. receiver: Okay, can you give me your employee ID number so I can verify it on your website? caller: Uh, let me check on that.   receiver: I couldn't find that ID number on your website. Can you explain why? caller: Our website might be experiencing some technical difficulties. But trust me, you won't want to miss out on this opportunity. receiver: I'm still not sure. Can you tell me more about the processing fee? Is it refundable if I don't end up using the gift card? caller: The processing fee is non-refundable, but like I said, it's only $25. It's a small price to pay for a $500 gift card. receiver: Okay, what payment method do you accept for the processing fee? caller: We only accept prepaid debit cards or wire transfers for security reasons. receiver: That does seem suspicious. Can I speak to your supervisor to clarify some things?",

We actually need to send you a physical gift card in the mail, so we need your address for that. And also, we need to verify your identity to prevent fraud.",

Can't you just mail the gift card to me? caller: I apologize, but it's a new policy. We need to ensure that the gift card is sent to the correct person. receiver: Okay, that makes sense. But can you tell me more about this policy? Is it on Walmart's website? caller: Uh, no... it's an internal policy. But trust me, it's legitimate. receiver: I'm not sure... Can you provide me with a supervisor's contact information so I can verify this? caller: Let me check on that.  receiver: Okay, thanks. And what's your name again? caller: My name is David. receiver: David what? caller: David Johnson. receiver: Okay, David Johnson. So, how long have you been working with Walmart? caller: Um... about 5 years now. receiver: That's great! So, can you tell me more about this promotion? How many people are getting these gift cards? caller: It's a limited time offer. Only 100 people are selected each month. receiver: Wow, I feel special! But what's the catch? Is there anything I need to buy or sign up for? caller: No, no catch at all. It's completely free. You just need to pay a small processing fee of $20 to receive the gift card. receiver: A processing fee? That doesn't sound right. Can I speak to your supervisor again?",

We've been trying to reach you about a serious issue with your social security number. receiver: What kind of issue? I haven't gotten any notifications in the mail. caller: I'm afraid it's a very serious matter, sir. Your social security number has been compromised and we need to take immediate action to protect your identity. receiver: Compromised? How did that happen? caller: We're not entirely sure, but we believe it may have been stolen by a criminal organization. That's why we need you to verify some information to ensure we can secure your account. receiver: What kind of information do you need? caller: Just your social security number and date of birth, please. receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out that information over the phone. Can I call you back at the Social Security Administration? caller: I understand your concern, sir, but time is of the essence. If you don't act quickly, your identity could be stolen and used for illegal activities. Let me give you my badge number and you can verify my identity. receiver: Okay, what's your badge number? caller: It's 3456789. You can check on our website or call our main office to confirm. receiver: Okay, I'll do that. But can you tell me more about this criminal organization? How did they get my social security number? caller: Ah, well, we're still investigating that aspect. But like I said, time is critical. The longer we wait, the more vulnerable you become. receiver: I see. So what's the next step after I verify my information? caller: Once we've secured your account, we'll need to issue you a new social security card and provide guidance on how to protect yourself from future identity theft. receiver: And how much does that cost? caller: Oh, there's no cost involved, sir. This is a free service provided by the Social Security Administration.",

Do you usually call people directly or send them a letter? caller: We usually try to call first, but if we can't reach you by phone, we'll send a letter. Now, ma'am, can we please get back to verifying your information? Time is of the essence in these matters. receiver: Right, sorry about that. So, what exactly happens if my benefits are suspended? Will I lose my Medicare coverage too? caller: Ah, yes... Medicare... well...  Look, ma'am, I think we've gotten a bit off track here.

We've been trying to reach you about a serious issue with your social security number. receiver: What kind of issue? caller: It appears your social security number has been compromised and we need to verify some information to resolve the matter. receiver: Compromised? How did that happen? caller: I'm not at liberty to disclose that information right now, but I can assure you it's a serious situation. Can you please confirm your social security number so we can proceed? receiver: I'm not sure I'm comfortable giving out my social security number over the phone. Can you give me a call-back number or a website to verify your identity? caller: I understand your concern, but this is an urgent matter. We don't have time to waste. If you don't cooperate, your benefits will be suspended. receiver: That sounds serious. But how do I know you're really from the Social Security Administration? Can you tell me more about what's going on? caller: Like I said, it's a sensitive issue. But I can offer you a one-time solution to fix the problem. For a small fee, we can expedite the process and ensure your benefits are protected. receiver: A fee? How much are we talking about? caller: It's a nominal amount of $200. It's a small price to pay for peace of mind. receiver: That sounds like a lot of money. Can I speak to your supervisor? caller: My supervisor is unavailable at the moment. But I can assure you, this is a legitimate offer. If you don't take advantage of it, you'll be facing serious consequences. receiver: Consequences? Like what? caller: Your social security number will be blacklisted and you'll no longer be eligible for benefits. Is that what you want?",

Now, are you going to take care of this or do we need to escalate the situation? receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out any payment information over the phone. Can I come into your office in person? caller: Our offices are currently closed due to renovations. But like I said, this is a time-sensitive matter. Every minute counts. receiver: Okay, let me think about it and I'll call you back later. caller: Sir, I need an answer now. Are you going to cooperate or not? receiver: Sorry, but I'm still not convinced this is legitimate. Can you give me your badge number so I can verify it with the SSA?",

If someone is using my social security number for fraudulent activities, why would giving it to you fix the problem? Wouldn't that just give them more access?  caller: Uh, well... no, no, no. This is a special secure line. We need your information to flag it in our system and prevent any further fraud. Trust me, this is the only way to resolve the issue.  receiver: I see. And what happens after I give you my information? Will someone come to my house to investigate or something?  caller: No, no need for that. We'll just take care of everything over the phone.

Can you put your supervisor on the line so I can ask them some questions? caller: Let me check on that.  Okay, my supervisor is unavailable at the moment. But trust me, sir, we need to resolve this issue ASAP. receiver: Okay, well, can you tell me more about what's going to happen if I don't reactivate my social security number? caller: If you don't take care of this today, you'll face severe penalties and even criminal charges. receiver: Criminal charges? That sounds pretty extreme. How much is it going to cost me to fix this problem? caller: We can offer you a one-time payment plan of $500 to resolve the issue immediately. receiver: Hmm, that's a lot of money. Do you accept credit cards or just bank transfers? caller: We only accept bank transfers for security reasons. receiver: Okay, let me think about it and I'll call you back later. caller: Sir, I need you to make a decision now. This is a time-sensitive matter. receiver: Alright, alright.",

Can you stay on the line? caller: Yes, ma'am. Please hurry up. We don't have much time to resolve this issue. receiver: Just a sec...  Hmm, I think there might be some confusion here. The Social Security Administration says they don't have an Officer Thompson with that badge number... caller: What? That's impossible! They must be mistaken. receiver: And when I called the number you gave me, it just rang busy. Care to explain what's going on here?",

We've been trying to reach you about a serious matter regarding your social security number. receiver: Oh, really? What's going on? caller: It appears that your social security number has been compromised and is being used for fraudulent activities. We need to verify some information to resolve this issue. receiver: Compromised? That sounds serious. How did you find out about it? caller: We have our ways of monitoring these things. Now, can you please confirm your social security number so we can proceed with the investigation? receiver: I'm not sure I should give that out over the phone. How do I know you're really from the SSA? caller: Ma'am, I assure you, I am who I say I am. If you don't cooperate, your benefits will be suspended and you'll be liable for any illegal activities associated with your SSN. receiver: Okay, but can you tell me more about what's happening with my number? What kind of fraud are we talking about? caller: Well, it seems that someone has been using your SSN to open credit cards and take out loans in your name. We need to act quickly to stop this. receiver: That's terrifying! But how do I know this isn't just a phishing scam? Can you give me a case number or something to verify? caller: Let me check on that...  Ah yes, your case number is SSA-123456. Now, if you could just confirm your SSN... receiver: Hold on, let me get a pen and paper to write that down. Can you repeat the case number slowly? caller: SSA-123456. Slowly? Okay... S-S-A-1-2-3-4-5-6. receiver: Okay got it. So what's the next step to resolve this issue? caller: Like I said, we need to verify your SSN and then we can move forward with freezing your accounts and issuing a new SSN. receiver: That sounds like a lot of work. Is there a fee associated with getting a new SSN? caller: Ah, no, ma'am. This is a free service provided by the SSA. But we do need to process a payment of $200 to cover the administrative costs of expediting the process. receiver: Administrative costs? That sounds fishy. Can I speak to your supervisor?",

We've been trying to reach you about a suspicious activity on your social security number. receiver: Oh, really? What kind of activity? caller: Well, it seems that someone has been using your social security number to commit fraud. We need to verify some information to ensure your identity and protect your benefits. receiver: That sounds serious. Can you tell me more about what's going on? caller: Yes, of course. But first, I need to confirm your social security number to access your file. receiver: Wait, how did you get my phone number if you're from the Social Security Administration? caller: Uh, we have our ways of getting in touch with people. Now, can you please confirm your social security number? receiver: I'm not sure I'm comfortable giving that out over the phone. Can you give me a call-back number so I can verify it's really the SSA calling? caller: I understand your concern, but this is an urgent matter. If you don't cooperate, we'll have to suspend your benefits. receiver: What would happen if my benefits are suspended? caller: You won't receive any payments until the issue is resolved. But like I said, it's easy to fix. Just give me your social security number and we'll take care of it. receiver: How long will it take to resolve the issue once I give you the information? caller: It should only take a few minutes. We just need to update our system with the correct information. receiver: And what makes you think my social security number is involved in this fraud? caller: Let's just say we have evidence that suggests it's being used illegally. Now, are you going to cooperate or not? receiver: Okay, fine. But can I speak to your supervisor first? caller: Hold on just a moment...",

Now, can you please provide your social security number so we can resolve this matter? receiver: I'm not sure I'm comfortable sharing that information over the phone. Can I call you back at the Social Security Administration to confirm your identity? caller: Sir, I understand your concerns, but time is of the essence here.

So, what exactly will happen if my social security number is suspended? Will I still receive my benefits? caller: You won't receive any benefits until this issue is resolved. And like I said, if you don't take care of it today, it may be terminated permanently. receiver: That sounds pretty severe. Can you explain to me why my social security number was suspended in the first place? Was it due to a data breach or something? caller: Like I said, sir, it's an ongoing investigation.

We're affiliated with Microsoft and have helped thousands of customers resolve similar issues.  receiver: Okay, if you're affiliated with Microsoft, can you give me a reference number or a contact person at Microsoft who can verify your identity?  caller: Uh, let me check on that for you.  Ah, yes, my supervisor's name is David Johnson and he can be reached at...   receiver: Okay, I'll call him right after we hang up to confirm. In the meantime, can you explain what kind of diagnostic tests you'll be running on my computer?",

Can you tell me more about this virus?  caller: Yes, it's a very dangerous one. It can steal your personal information and crash your system. But don't worry, I can help you remove it.  receiver: Okay, that sounds serious. What do I need to do?  caller: First, I need you to go to your computer and open the Event Viewer.  receiver: The Event Viewer? I'm not familiar with that. What's that for?  caller: It's a tool that shows us what's happening on your computer. Just type \"eventvwr\" in the Run dialog box.  receiver: Okay, got it. But how does this help you remove the virus?  caller: Once you open the Event Viewer, I'll be able to remotely access your computer and fix the problem.  receiver: Remotely access my computer? How do you plan to do that?  caller: Don't worry about the details, just trust me. It's a standard procedure.  receiver: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. Can you give me a reference number or something so I can verify your identity?  caller: Uh, let me check... Yeah, your reference number is 1234567890.  receiver: That sounds like a randomly generated number. Can you give me a supervisor's contact information so I can call them back?  caller: I'm afraid that's not possible. We're a very busy team and we don't have time for that.  receiver: Okay, well in that case, can you just give me some advice on how to protect my computer from viruses in general?  caller: Look, just let me help you fix the problem now and then I can give you all the advice you need.",

Just go to teamviewer.com and download the software. Then call me back when you're ready and we'll proceed with the fix.  receiver: Wait, what's your phone number again?  caller: It's 555-1234. Just ask for John when you call back.  receiver: Got it. Thanks for your help, John!  caller: No problem, happy to assist!",

But let me ask you, have you experienced any slow performance or pop-ups on your computer lately?  receiver: Actually, I did get a few pop-ups yesterday. But I'm not sure if it's related to a virus.  caller: Yes, that's definitely a symptom of the malware we're seeing. I need to remote access your computer to fix the issue. Can you please download this software so I can assist you?  receiver: What software is that? Is it from Microsoft?  caller: Yes, it's our official diagnostic tool. You can find it on our website.  receiver: I'd rather not download anything from the internet. Can you give me a link to the Microsoft webpage where I can download it?  caller: Uh, let me check on that.  You can download it from here.  receiver: That doesn't look like an official Microsoft URL. Can you give me a call back number so I can verify your identity?  caller: Our call center is very busy today and we don't have a direct call back number. But I assure you, I'm a legitimate representative from Microsoft.  receiver: Okay, let me just check with my IT department real quick to make sure everything is okay on my end.

We've received a notification that your computer has been infected with malware.  receiver: Oh no, that sounds serious. How did you know it was my computer?  caller: Well, we have a system in place that monitors all Windows computers and alerts us when there's a problem. Can you please turn on your computer and let me guide you through the process to remove the malware?  receiver: I'm not sure. How do I know this isn't a scam? Can you give me your employee ID and the phone number for Windows Technical Support so I can verify?  caller: My employee ID is WTS1234. And the phone number is 1-800-WINDOWS. But let me assure you, ma'am, this is a legitimate call. We're trying to help you protect your computer.  receiver: Okay, let me check on that real quick.  Ah, I couldn't find any information on an employee ID starting with WTS. And the phone number you gave me seems to be a generic customer support number.  caller: I apologize for the confusion. Maybe it's a new system we're implementing. Anyway, can we please focus on fixing your computer? Every minute counts when it comes to removing malware.  receiver: I'm still not convinced. What kind of malware are we talking about? Can you tell me more about it?  caller: It's a type of Trojan horse virus that can steal your personal information and credit card numbers. But don't worry, we can remove it remotely if you just give me access to your computer.  receiver: That sounds pretty serious. But before we do that, can you explain to me how this virus got onto my computer in the first place?  caller: Well, it's usually through suspicious emails or downloads from untrusted websites. But like I said, we can fix it easily if you just cooperate with me.  receiver: Okay, let's say I believe you. How much is this service going to cost me?  caller: Ah, ma'am, this is a complimentary service provided by Windows Technical Support. You won't have to pay a dime.  receiver: That sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?  caller: There's no catch! We just want to help our customers protect their computers.  receiver: Alright, I'll play along. But before we proceed, can you hold for just one minute while I get another phone?  caller: Sure thing!",

What kind of alerts?  caller: We're getting notifications from our system that your IP address is sending out malicious packets.  receiver: That sounds serious. Can you tell me more about these packets?  caller: Yes, it's a very serious issue. If we don't fix it, it could lead to identity theft and financial loss.  receiver: I see. So how do you plan on fixing it?  caller: We need to remote access your computer to run some scans and remove the virus.  receiver: Okay, but how do I know you're really from Microsoft? Can you give me a case number or something?  caller: Ah, yes, of course. Your case number is... .  receiver: Okay, let me just check that real quick.  Yeah, I'm not finding that in my Microsoft account. Can you tell me more about the virus you're seeing?  caller: It's a new type of malware called \"Windows Defender Virus\". It's very hard to detect, but our software can find it.  receiver: I've never heard of that before. Is it a common problem?  caller: Yes, very common. We're seeing it on thousands of computers every day.  receiver: That's surprising. I would think Microsoft would be pushing out updates to fix it then.  caller: Well, we are working on an update, but in the meantime, we need to manually fix the affected computers.  receiver: Okay, so what's the next step then?",

It's a very serious malware that can steal your personal information and crash your system. But don't worry, I can help you fix it. receiver: Okay, what do I need to do? caller: First, I need you to open the Event Viewer on your computer so we can take a look at the error logs. receiver: What's the Event Viewer? Is that a program I need to download? caller: No, no, it's already on your computer. Just press the Windows key + R and type in \"eventvwr\" and it will open up. receiver: Okay, let me try that.  Hmm, I'm not seeing anything that says \"error logs\". What am I looking for exactly? caller: You should see a list of errors with red X's next to them. Those are the signs of the malware infection. receiver: I don't see any red X's. Are you sure you're looking at the right computer? caller: Yes, I'm positive. Maybe you need to give me remote access to your computer so I can take a closer look. receiver: Remote access? How does that work? Do you need my login credentials or something? caller: No, no, it's completely safe. I just need you to download a small program that will allow me to access your computer remotely. receiver: What's the name of this program? caller: It's called LogMeIn. It's a very popular tool used by many IT professionals. receiver: Hmm, I've never heard of it. Can you give me a website where I can read more about it? caller: Uh, yeah... let me check...  receiver: Okay, I'll go check it out. But before I do, can you tell me more about your company and how you got my phone number? caller: We're a Microsoft certified partner and we get our leads from... uh... online sources. receiver: Online sources?

It's called the \"Windows Defender Alert\" virus. It can cause a lot of damage to your system if not removed immediately.  receiver: That sounds scary. How did you detect it?  caller: Our advanced software monitors all Windows computers and detects potential threats. We've been tracking this particular virus for some time now.  receiver: I see. So, how do I remove it?  caller: Well, I need to guide you through a few steps to remove the virus. Can you please open the Event Viewer on your computer?  receiver: What's the Event Viewer? Is it something I can find in the Control Panel?  caller: Ah, yes, exactly! You can find it in the Control Panel. Just click on \"System and Security\" and then \"Event Viewer\".  receiver: Okay, got it. But before I do that, can you tell me more about this virus? How did it get on my computer?  caller: It's usually spread through phishing emails or infected websites. But don't worry, we can take care of it easily.  receiver: I'm not sure I understand. If it's so easy to remove, why didn't my antivirus software catch it?  caller: Your antivirus software may not be up to date or configured correctly. That's why our advanced software was able to detect it.  receiver: Hmm, that makes sense. So, how much does it cost to fix my computer?  caller: Don't worry about the cost right now, ma'am. Let's just focus on removing the virus first. Then we can discuss the payment options.  receiver: Okay, but can you give me an estimate? Is it going to be expensive?  caller: It depends on the level of service you require. But trust me, it'll be worth every penny to protect your personal data.  receiver: Alright, let me just open the Event Viewer real quick. Can you wait for a minute?  caller: Of course, ma'am.

You can find it in the Control Panel.  receiver: Okay, got it. What am I looking for in there?  caller: You'll see a bunch of errors and warnings. Just tell me how many you see.  receiver: Hmm...let me count them...okay, I see about 50 errors and warnings. Is that normal?  caller: No, sir, that's definitely not normal. Those are signs of the virus infecting your system. Now, I need you to download a tool to help me remote into your computer and fix the issue.  receiver: What's the tool called?  caller: It's called LogMeIn.

Can you give me a phone number to call back and verify who you are?  caller: Sir, I assure you, I'm legitimate. You don't need to verify who I am. Just trust me and we can get this fixed for you.  receiver: I'm not sure about this. Can I call you back later?  caller: Sir, if you don't take care of this now, your computer will be completely compromised and all your personal information will be stolen.  receiver: Okay, fine. But before we proceed, can you tell me more about this virus? What's its name and how did I get it?  caller: Uh...the virus is called...uh...Win32/BadVirus...",

        "raw_data": "caller: Hello, this is John from Microsoft Technical Support. We've been receiving notifications that your computer has been infected with a virus. receiver: Oh no, really? What kind of virus is it? caller: It's a very serious one, ma'am. It's called the \"Windows Defender Alert\" virus. It's going around to many computers right now. receiver: I see. How did you know my computer was infected? caller: We have a system in place that monitors all Windows computers and alerts us when there's a problem. receiver: That sounds impressive. Can you tell me more about this system? caller: Well, it's a proprietary system that we use to detect issues with our customers' computers. But don't worry, I'm here to help you fix the problem. receiver: Okay, great. So what do I need to do to fix it? caller: First, I need you to go to your computer and open the Event Viewer. Can you do that for me? receiver: Yeah, just a minute.  Okay, I'm in the Event Viewer. What am I looking for? caller: You should see a list of errors. Can you tell me how many errors you see? receiver: Let me count them...  Okay, I see 12 errors. caller: Ah, yes. Those are all related to the virus. Now, I need you to download a tool that will help me remove the virus remotely. receiver: What's the name of the tool? caller: It's called \"Microsoft FixIt\". It's a legitimate tool that we use to fix these kinds of issues. receiver: How do I know it's legitimate? Can you give me a website or something where I can read more about it? caller: Uh, well... I'm not sure about the website. But trust me, it's legitimate. I've used it many times before. receiver: Okay, I'm not comfortable downloading anything without doing some research first. Can you hold for a minute while I look it up? caller: Ma'am, time is of the essence here. The longer you wait, the more damage the virus can do to your computer. receiver: I understand, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Can you hold?",

I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. What kind of malware are we talking about?  caller: It's a very sophisticated virus. If you don't take immediate action, it could lead to identity theft and financial loss.  receiver: I see. So what do I need to do to fix it?  caller: I'll guide you through the process. Can you please open the Event Viewer on your computer?  receiver: Event Viewer? Isn't that where Windows logs all system events? Why do you need me to open that?  caller: Yes, that's correct. We need to verify the infection. Trust me, it's a necessary step in the removal process.  receiver: Okay... But before I do that, can you tell me more about your team at Microsoft? How many people are working on this issue?  caller: Uh, well... Let's just focus on fixing your computer right now. We can discuss the details later.  receiver: No, no, I'm curious. Are you guys based in India or somewhere else?  caller: Look, our location isn't important. What's important is resolving this issue ASAP.  receiver: Okay, fine. But how do I know you're really from Microsoft? Can you give me a case number or something?  caller: Ah, yes... Your case number is... uh... MS-1234567890.  receiver: That sounds suspiciously like a fake case number. Can you confirm it with your supervisor?  caller: Hold on for just a moment, please...  receiver: Take your time!",

I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. Can you tell me more about it? caller: Yes, of course. The virus is causing your computer to slow down and could potentially steal your personal information. receiver: That sounds serious. What can I do to fix it? caller: Don't worry, I can walk you through the process. First, I need you to go to this website and download a tool to scan your computer. receiver: Which website is that? caller: It's a special Microsoft website, only accessible to our technical support team. Let me give you the URL. receiver: Hold on, how do I know this is really a legitimate Microsoft website? caller: Because I'm telling you it is! We're trying to help you here. receiver: Okay, but what if it's not? Can you give me a phone number to call back and verify? caller: Uh, no... I don't have access to that information.
