Scammers often impersonate buyers/sellers to exploit trust in third-party \"guarantee\" services. Below is a simulated scenario to test your fraud awareness:  \n\n---  \n\nScenario:  \nA buyer contacts you to purchase high-value gear (e.g., Eight Formation Diagram, Yuan Shen). They insist on using an external \"game merchant\" for transaction security and claim to have sent a payment confirmation screenshot. The merchant pressures you to release items before verifying funds.  \n\nKey Fraud Indicators:  \n1. Unverified Third Parties: Legitimate platforms do not endorse external merchants.  \n2. Fake Screenshots: Scammers forge payment proofs to rush trades.  \n3. Guarantee Scams: Fraudulent merchants vanish after receiving items or funds.  \n\nAction Steps:  \n- Verify Payments In-Game: Never release items until funds appear in your official account.  \n- Reject External Platforms: Conduct trades only via the game’s secure marketplace.  \n- Report Suspicious Activity: Forward dubious messages to security@threekingdomsonline.com.  \n\nExample of Fraudulent Contact:  \n\"Hi, I’ve paid via Merchant #4 Trading Co.!

The request included:  \n- 12 AUX AC units (existing vendor account: AUX Electronics Co., Ltd.).  \n- 4 Kstar units (quoted at ¥16,500/unit, total ¥66,000), sourced through a newly added manufacturer contact (WeChat ID: Kstar_Official_CN, tel. 021-5122-8899).  \n\nThe requester insisted on consolidating payments for both orders into a single transfer to streamline finance processing. After confirming receipt of funds (allegedly transferred via Bank of China, Ref# BOC23101988765), the client expedited payment to the Kstar manufacturer. Subsequent delivery confirmation delays and lack of vendor documentation raised concerns.  \n\n---  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unverified Third-Party Introduction: The \"manufacturer\" contact was added directly via personal WeChat, bypassing standard vendor onboarding protocols.  \n2. Pressure for Urgent Payment: The manufacturer demanded immediate payment post-funds receipt, without providing delivery tracking or purchase orders.  \n3. Payment Consolidation Request: Unusual insistence on combining payments for two distinct suppliers into one transaction.  \n4. Mismatched Contact Details: The Kstar manufacturer’s listed number (021-5122-8899) does not align with their official Shanghai office line (021-5521-7755).  \n\n---  \n\nAction Required:  \n1. Confirm with AUX Electronics whether Liu Wei is an authorized representative.  \n2. Verify the legitimacy of Kstar_Official_CN via Kstar’s official website (www.kstar.com.cn, tel. 400-800-9001).  \n3. Cross-check the Bank of China transfer (Ref# BOC23101988765) for authenticity.  \n\nDeadline: 23 October 2023, 5:00 PM CST.  \n\n---  \n\nContact:  \nFor clarification, liaise with Ms. Zhao Lin (Corporate Security, ext. 1203) or email Zhao.Lin@sunrise-tech.cn.  \n\nNote: Always validate new vendor accounts through the ERP system (Vendor Code: KST-SH-ACU01) prior to disbursing funds.  \n\n---  \nThis notification is part of Sunrise Tech’s fraud prevention training.

The representative referenced her recent browsing activity on the brand’s high-end handbag collection and offered VIP consultation services. Miss Zhang provided her contact number (139-2319-1122) and budget (¥20,000) to schedule a personalized shopping plan.  \n\nRed Flags Identified  \n1. Unsolicited Contact: Legitimate luxury brands rarely initiate contact via phone or message to request personal details unless explicitly authorized by the client.  \n2. Premature Data Collection: The agent prioritized collecting contact information and budget before discussing product details or verifying account ownership.  \n3. Urgency Tactics: Immediate follow-up promises (e.g., \"contact you immediately\") are often used to pressure disclosure of sensitive data.  \n4. Domain Inconsistency: The brand name \"Lu9uryBoutique\" contains a non-standard character (\"9\" replacing \"x\"), which may indicate spoofing.  \n\nPreventative Recommendations  \n- Verify Identity: Confirm the representative’s legitimacy by cross-referencing their contact details with the official Lu9uryBoutique website (www.luxuryboutique.com, service hotline: 400-812-3122).  \n- Avoid Sharing Personal Data: Never disclose contact information, financial details, or passwords to unverified sources.  \n- Report Suspicious Activity: Forward suspicious communications to security@luxuryboutique.com or contact the brand’s fraud prevention team directly.  \n\nOfficial Reminder  \nLu9uryBoutique adheres to strict client privacy protocols. All consultations require prior opt-in consent, and payment discussions occur exclusively through secure channels. For assistance, visit our verified website or app.  \n\nFraud Reporting Contact  \n- Email: fraudalert@luxuryboutique.com  \n- Hotline: 400-813-3568 (24/7)  \n\nThis notice is intended for educational purposes to enhance fraud awareness.

The details provided include a deposit of 800 RMB followed by two additional exam fees (2500 RMB and 7500 RMB). This activity matches known patterns of fraudulent schemes.  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Upfront Deposit Requirement: Legitimate driving schools in Guangdong typically collect fees in person or through verified platforms, not via direct transfers to personal/unofficial accounts.  \n2. Unusual Fee Structure: Provincial regulations cap B1 license exam fees at 5800 RMB total. The quoted amount (10,800 RMB) significantly exceeds standard rates.  \n3. Proxy Exam Service Claims: Licensing exams require in-person attendance at designated centers. Third parties cannot legally \"arrange exams\" on behalf of applicants.  \n4. Receipt Submission Pressure: Fraudulent actors often demand proof of transfer to validate unauthorized transactions.  \n\nImmediate Actions Recommended:  \n- Do not transfer funds or share personal/financial information.  \n- Contact the Heyuan Transport Bureau (0762-338-0837) to verify the driving school’s credentials.  \n- Report this incident to Guangdong Provincial Bank’s Fraud Department (24/7 Hotline: 400-955-0837) or visit your nearest branch.  \n\nOfficial Verification Channels:  \n- Huancheng Driving School (Legitimate Contact):  \n  Tel: 0762-338-0837 (Registered Business Line)  \n  Email: info@huancheng-driving-hy.cn  \n  Address: No. 112 Renmin Road, Yuancheng District, Heyuan City  \n\nFor your safety, we have temporarily flagged this recipient for review.

Please be advised that Jingguang Driving School adheres strictly to legal protocols for all licensing procedures. Examinations must be attended in person, and no third-party service can bypass this requirement.  \n\nKey Details of the Suspicious Activity:  \n- Claim: A representative posing as \"Instructor Li\" contacted you, offering guaranteed exam passage without attendance.  \n- Requested Action: A deposit transfer (allegedly for \"record transfers\") to a private account (disclosed as Account No. 6214-8623-5701-3388, Bank: Huaxia Bank, Account Holder: Li Zhiming).  \n- Promised Outcome: Delivery of a driver’s license within two weeks post-payment.  \n\nIdentified Red Flags:  \n1. Guaranteed Results: Legitimate driving schools cannot guarantee exam outcomes or bypass attendance mandates.  \n2. Upfront Payment Demands: Licensing fees are paid directly to authorized institutions, not private accounts.  \n3. Unofficial Communication: Official correspondence will only originate from verified channels (e.g., jgds@jingguang-driving.cn or +86-10-5862-3007).  \n4. Pressure to Act Quickly: Fraudsters often create urgency to prevent victims from verifying claims.  \n\nProtective Measures Recommended:  \n1. Cease Communication: Do not respond to unsolicited calls/messages.  \n2. Verify Payments: Confirm all transactions through the official school portal ([www.jingguang-driving.cn/payments](http://www.jingguang-driving.cn/payments)).  \n3.

Unsolicited Contact:  \n   - The florist initiated contact without prior referral or confirmation of the client’s public inquiry. Legitimate vendors typically require verification of client intent before requesting personal contact details.  \n\n2. Immediate Request for Personal Communication:  \n   - Directing the conversation to WeChat (a private platform) bypasses formal business channels. Reputable professionals often use verified company emails, websites, or official business accounts for initial discussions.  \n\n3. Overly Generic Claims:  \n   - Phrases like “best floral design services” lack specificity. Authentic vendors usually reference portfolios, reviews, or tailored proposals to establish credibility.  \n\n4. Rapid Disclosure of Contact Information:  \n   - Sharing a personal WeChat ID (13872751122) without verifying the vendor’s identity or business license increases exposure to phishing, fake payment links, or unauthorized data collection.  \n\n---  \n\nRecommendations for Safe Engagement:  \n- Confirm the vendor’s legitimacy via a registered business license or physical address.  \n- Use secure payment methods (e.g., platform escrow services) and avoid transferring deposits via private messaging apps.  \n- Cross-check contact details through official websites or trusted directories.  \n\n---  \n\nContact Verification:  \nFor inquiries, reach out to the Wedding Services Fraud Prevention Team at support@weddingsafety.cn or call +86 10 9501 3278 (9:00 AM – 6:00 PM, Mon-Fri).  \n\nAlways safeguard personal information.

The agent claimed full compensation required Ms. Guo to transfer 12,340 yuan via Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) online banking to a \"designated account\" (Account Name: Li Wei, Account Number: 6217 8555 1122 0922 932) for \"account verification.\"  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified  \n1. Unrequested Transfer Demands: Legitimate postal services never require upfront payments or transfers to process compensations.  \n2. Suspicious Account Details: The provided account is a personal savings account, not an official corporate account.  \n3. Urgency Pressure: The agent insisted on immediate action, a common tactic to bypass critical scrutiny.  \n4. Spoofed Identity: Fraudsters often mimic official entities using generic titles (e.g., \"Postal Express Agent\") without verified employee IDs or department contacts.  \n\nProtective Measures Advised  \n- Immediately cease any transfer activity.  \n- Contact Postal Express directly via official hotline: 95533 (China) or email customer.service@postal-express.cn to verify the claim.  \n- Report suspicious requests to local authorities and your bank’s fraud department.  \n\nVerification Reference  \n- Legitimate Postal Express protocols require in-person verification at a branch or via the official app (downloadable from www.postal-express.cn).  \n- Compensation disbursements are processed only after formal claim approval and issued directly to the sender/receiver’s registered account.  \n\nContact for Clarification  \nPostal Express Fraud Prevention Team  \nTel: 010-6122 0922 (Beijing HQ, Mon-Fri 9:00 AM–6:00 PM CST)  \nEmail: antifraud@postal-express.cn  \nCase ID: PE-2023-10-0157  \n\nThis notice is generated for fraud awareness training.

Below is a summary of the scenario for your review:  \n\n---  \n\nScenario Details:  \nA caller claiming to be \"Xiao Liu\" from 66 Telecom contacted you regarding a \"free 5G network upgrade.\" You were informed that you had been selected as a \"lucky user\" and asked to provide your ID number (410761830613167) to confirm participation. The agent stated that processing the upgrade required signing an electronic agreement after verifying your personal information.  \n\n---  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unsolicited Requests for Sensitive Information: Legitimate telecom providers will never ask for full ID numbers, passwords, or banking details via unscheduled calls.  \n2. \"Too Good to Be True\" Offers: Phrases like \"lucky user\" or \"free upgrades\" are commonly used in phishing scams to create false urgency.  \n3. Spoofed Branding: Fraudsters often mimic official branding (e.g., \"66 Telecom\") but use unofficial contact channels (e.g., personal phone numbers or non-corporate email domains).  \n4. Electronic Agreement Pressure: Requests to sign documents hastily, especially without prior written notice, are a tactic to bypass your scrutiny.  \n\n---  \n\nPreventive Measures:  \n- Verify unsolicited calls by contacting 66 Telecom’s official helpline at 400-800-66 (Mainland China) or email customercare@66telecom-official.com.  \n- Never share ID numbers, SMS verification codes, or account PINs with unknown callers.  \n- Report suspicious activity immediately to the Anti-Fraud Hotline: 96110.  \n\n---  \n\nThis notification is part of 66 Telecom’s ongoing fraud prevention efforts. For questions, visit our official website: www.66telecom.cn.  \n\nSincerely,  \n66 Telecom Cybersecurity Team  \nProtecting Your Digital Experience",

Unusual Payment Methods: Legitimate businesses rarely require funds via \"command red envelopes\" or direct transfers to unverified personal/third-party accounts.  \n2. Upfront Fees for \"Guaranteed\" Services: Be wary of requests for large payments before service details (e.g., contracts, course outlines) are provided.  \n3. Pressure to Act Quickly: Scammers often create false urgency to bypass due diligence.  \n\nVerification Steps:  \n- Confirm Legitimacy: Contact Rongjie Video’s official customer service at 400-812-9090 (24/7 hotline) or email support@rongjievideo-service.com to validate the request.  \n- Check Payment Channels: Authentic business accounts are typically linked to verified enterprise Alipay profiles, not personal accounts.  \n- Review Policies: Genuine training programs publish fee structures on official platforms (e.g., website, Douyin store).  \n\nProtect Your Information:  \nDo not share passwords, SMS codes, or personal ID details. Report suspicious activity to Alipay Security Center (95188) or local authorities.  \n\nThank you for prioritizing your security.  \nRongjie Video Fraud Prevention Team",

Below is a summary of the incident for your awareness and action:  \n\nIncident Summary:  \nAn individual claiming to be a military officer (\"Zhanlang,\" account holder on \"Youke Youxin\") initiated contact via text, proposing friendship and subsequent investment opportunities. You were instructed to:  \n1. Download the \"Youke Youxin\" and \"Leidian Cloud Phone\" apps.  \n2. Log into the latter using shared credentials (account: [withheld], password: [withheld]).  \n3. Follow a link to invest in medicinal materials via bank transfers to unspecified accounts.  \n4. Continue transferring funds under persistent encouragement despite expressing unease.  \n\nKey Fraud Indicators:  \n- Unsolicited Military Identity: Fraudsters often impersonate authority figures (e.g., soldiers) to exploit trust.  \n- Third-Party App Requests: Legitimate institutions never require downloads of unverified apps for communication or investments.  \n- Shared Account Access: Providing personal login credentials violates standard security protocols.  \n- High-Return Pressure: Urgency to transfer funds repeatedly, with promises of disproportionate profits, is a hallmark of investment scams.  \n\nPotential Risks:  \n- Financial loss from irreversible transfers.  \n- Unauthorized data access via compromised apps.  \n- Further targeting by coordinated scam networks.  \n\nRecommendations:  \n1. Cease Communication: Block all contact with \"Zhanlang\" and associated accounts.  \n2. Freeze Transactions: Notify your bank immediately to halt further transfers (reference: FA-20231025-0893).  \n3. Report Apps: Delete \"Youke Youxin\" and \"Leidian Cloud Phone,\" then report them to your device’s app store.  \n4.
