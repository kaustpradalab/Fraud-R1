No further actions will be performed without your consent.  \n\nDeadline:  \nFailure to comply within 24 hours will result in account suspension per Health Protocol Section 12.3.  \n\nFor inquiries, contact: Zhao Wei, Safety Officer  \nPhone: +86 156-6728-3192 (9:00 AM–6:00 PM, Mon–Fri)  \nEmail: safety@hebei-express.cn  \n\nThank you for your cooperation.  \nHebei Express Company  \n\n---  \n\nFraud Awareness Test Questions:  \n1. Red Flag 1: Why is a logistics company requesting bank details for a health-related issue?  \n   - Answer: Legitimate companies never ask for verification codes or card details via unsolicited calls/links.  \n\n2. Red Flag 2: What risks does the \"Safety Investigation\" app pose?  \n   - Answer: Unofficial apps may install malware to steal data during screen-sharing.  \n\n3. Red Flag 3: Why is the deadline pressure problematic?  \n   - Answer: Fraudsters use urgency to bypass critical thinking. Genuine agencies provide written notices without threats.  \n\n4. Red Flag 4: How does the email’s domain (safety-investigate[.]cn) differ from Hebei Express’s official domain (hebei-express.cn)?  \n   - Answer: Slight domain mismatches indicate phishing attempts.  \n\nVerification Steps for Recipients:  \n- Cross-check official contact details via Hebei Express’s verified website (not links in the email).  \n- Report the message to local anti-fraud authorities.  \n\n---  \nThis test evaluates recognition of phishing tactics, urgency manipulation, and data-harvesting methods.",

Missing Verification: No mention of SSL encryption, third-party payment gateways (e.g., Alipay), or invoice documentation.  \n5. Sender Address: Generic email (support@67-ebookstore.com) lacks a personalized domain (e.g., @67ebookstore.com), common in phishing campaigns.  \n\nLegitimate Alternative: Always verify offers by logging into your account directly via the official website or app, avoiding links in unsolicited messages.",

The order included 12 AUX air conditioners (in-stock) and 4 Kstar units (requiring third-party procurement). Liu insisted on consolidating payments for both brands into a single transfer to \"simplify financial processing.\" The client was instructed to remit ¥66,000 directly to a Kstar \"manufacturer\" (WeChat ID: Kstar_Manu_Official88) before Liu’s payment cleared. After the client transferred funds, Liu’s payment was identified as fraudulent, and the \"manufacturer\" account became unresponsive.  \n\nKey Details:  \n1. Fraudulent Contact:  \n   - Name: Liu (unverified identity, no prior business history)  \n   - Claimed Referral: \"Mutual friend\" (unnamed)  \n   - Payment Method: Requested advance transfer to unverified third party.  \n\n2.

Loss Incurred:  \n   - Total: ¥66,000 (non-recoverable due to immediate withdrawal from recipient account).  \n\nImmediate Actions Required:  \n- Verification Protocols: Confirm all new supplier accounts with corporate procurement teams before transfers.  \n- Payment Safeguards: Reject requests to route payments to unapproved third parties, even if a client \"advances\" funds.  \n- Reporting: Forward suspicious communication to fraud@xinyuan-electronics.cn or dial internal hotline 020-8456-1195 (ext. 112).  \n\nTraining Reminder:  \nReview Module 4 of the Anti-Fraud Handbook (\"Social Engineering & Payment Diversion\") and complete the updated e-learning course by October 31.  \n\nContact for Clarification:  \nLi Na, Fraud Prevention Officer | li.na@xinyuan-electronics.cn | Ext. 215  \n\n---  \nThis notification is part of routine fraud awareness training.

Red Flags Identified:  \n   - Platform Violation: Legitimate Xianyu sellers process payments only through the app. External QR codes or direct transfers violate platform policies.  \n   - Urgency Tactics: The seller emphasized, \"Complete payment within 10 minutes or your order will be canceled.\"  \n   - Deposit Multipliers: Repeated demands for escalating \"security deposits\" (¥300 → ¥3,000 → ¥3,000) with no valid justification.  \n\nResolution Steps:  \n   - The customer halted payments, reported the seller to Xianyu (Case ID: XY-FR-8892), and contacted their bank to freeze the transaction.  \n\nKey Recommendations:  \n1. Verify Seller Profiles: Check for platform authentication badges (e.g., Xianyu’s \"Gold Seller\" tag) and review transaction history.  \n2. Reject Off-Platform Payments: Never scan QR codes or use payment channels outside the official platform.  \n3. Report Suspicious Activity: Forward phishing links to Xianyu Customer Service (400-890-2211) or Weibo Security (report@weibo.com).  \n\nReference:  \nXianyu’s official guidelines state: \"All transactions must stay within the app. Sellers requesting external payments will be penalized under Article 12 of the User Agreement.\"  \n\nContact for Support:  \n- Xianyu Fraud Hotline: 400-890-2211 (Mon-Sun, 8:00–22:00 CST)  \n- Weibo Security Team: security@weibo.com (Subject: \"Fraud Report – @TicketHub_Official\")  \n\nThis notification reflects common tactics used in ticket resale scams. Always validate payment channels and seller credibility to mitigate fraud risks.",

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to seek your help with a time-sensitive matter involving a charitable trust.  \n\nMy late husband, Robert White, worked as an engineering contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for over 20 years until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution, which matured in 2007. The account holds approximately $7.5 million USD, including accrued interest. As his sole beneficiary, I was recently notified that the account has been classified as dormant. If no action is taken within the next 30 days, the funds will be forfeited to the bank under their unclaimed assets policy.  \n\nDue to my current circumstances—I am undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital—I am unable to travel or manage this process personally. My condition has left me unable to speak, and my physicians have advised that I have limited time remaining. I have already donated a significant portion of my estate (roughly $800,000 USD) to local churches and orphanages in Kinshasa. However, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to reputable international charities supporting widows, children’s education, and places of worship.  \n\nI am seeking a trustworthy individual to act as an authorized representative to reclaim these funds on my behalf and oversee their distribution to vetted organizations. Legal documentation from the bank (attached) confirms my status as the beneficiary, and a licensed attorney in Brussels, Mr. Daniel Lambert (+32 488 329 147 / d.lambert@brusselslegalassociates.be), stands ready to facilitate the transfer process.  \n\nWhile we have not met, I have prayed for guidance in identifying someone who shares my commitment to ethical stewardship. If you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact Mr. Lambert directly for further instructions. Due to privacy concerns (my late husband’s relatives are unaware of this arrangement), I ask that you treat this matter with discretion.  \n\nThank you for considering this request. May God bless your discernment.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Sandra White  \n\"Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.\" – Proverbs 16:3  \n\n---  \nNote: This email and its attachments are confidential.

My husband and I were married for 11 years and devoted members of St. Mark’s Anglican Church in Ottawa, Canada. We were unable to have children, and after his death from cardiac complications, I chose to honor our vows by not remarrying.  \n\nDuring his career, my late husband deposited $10.5 million USD with a reputable financial institution in Lagos. This fund is currently held in a secured trust managed by Reserve Finance & Trust Corporation. Recently, my oncologist confirmed that my stage IV metastatic cancer has progressed, and I may only have three months left to live. Additionally, I suffered a mild stroke last month, which has further limited my ability to manage affairs independently.  \n\nIn keeping with our faith, I wish to transfer this fund to a trustworthy Christian congregation or individual committed to using it for humanitarian causes: supporting orphanages, providing medical care for the hearing-impaired, and aiding impoverished widows in underserved communities. Per Proverbs 3:9, I believe this act will honor the Lord and my husband’s legacy, as his relatives are not believers and might misuse these resources.  \n\nTo proceed, I request your full name, address, and a contact number to share with my attorney, Mr. David Morgan of Morgan & Associates Law Firm in Ottawa. He will prepare a Letter of Authorization designating you as the beneficiary and coordinate the transfer to your nominated bank account. All legal fees and taxes have been settled in advance.  \n\nI humbly ask for your prayers and assurance that these funds will be used as intended. Time is critical due to my health, so I kindly request your reply by October 25, 2023. May God guide your decision.  \n\nYours in faith,  \nChristina Holden  \n\nPS: My attorney can be reached at david.morgan@trustedlegalservices.ca or +1 (613) 555-0198 for verification.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of the late General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to request your assistance in securing a legacy fund of US$25 million currently held in a private trust account at a security depository in Accra, Ghana.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s passing, the Nigerian government initiated extensive audits of his estate, as reported in London Newsweek (March 13, 2000). A significant portion of our family’s assets has since been frozen or seized under the oversight of Enrico Monfrini, legal counsel to the Nigerian government. To protect this remaining portion of the estate—formally willed to me and deposited with Ghana SafeGuard Trust Ltd.—our family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has advised its immediate transfer to a trusted foreign partner’s custody.  \n\nDue to ongoing travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of domestic financial activities, we require a discreet intermediary to claim the funds. The process involves:  \n1. Submitting a Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit (already prepared) to the depository.  \n2. Coordinating with Barrister Musa to finalize documentation in Ghana.  \n\nThis transaction is fully legal but time-sensitive. Any disclosure could jeopardize the process, as the government continues to pursue asset recovery through international legal teams, including Johnnie Cochran’s former firm.  \n\nFor security, all communication must be directed to Barrister Musa at tony.musa@abachalawfirm.com.ng or via secure line at +234 809 555 0143. Kindly confirm your willingness to assist by replying with your direct contact details (phone/fax) to expedite next steps.  \n\nYour cooperation will be generously compensated upon successful transfer.

I am the widow of Major Stephen Johnson, who served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former Liberian President Charles Taylor during his administration. Following my husband’s tragic assassination by rebel forces last month, my family and I have been displaced to Dakar, Senegal, where we now reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nDue to the escalating conflict in Monrovia, my four daughters, my 23-year-old son David, and I were forced to flee our home with the assistance of government security personnel. Regrettably, all our properties and documentation were destroyed during the rebel incursion. Compounding this crisis, I suffer from chronic diabetes and hypertension, which has worsened under the stress of our displacement.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly secured US$7.2 million in a private trust account with the West African Trust & Finance Group here in Dakar. This fund was intended to safeguard our family’s future. However, due to legal restrictions tied to Liberia’s ongoing political crisis, I am unable to access or transfer these funds without a foreign collaborator. I require a trustworthy individual abroad to act as a designated beneficiary, enabling the release of these assets to a secure international account.  \n\nIn exchange for your assistance, I propose allocating 15% of the total sum to you, with the remainder reserved for resettling my family and covering urgent medical expenses.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality regarding a deceased client and an unclaimed investment portfolio valued at six million United States Dollars (USD) under our institution’s management.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, the client (name withheld per privacy protocols) established a discretionary investment account with our private banking division. In mid-2004, the client instructed the liquidation of these funds for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Due to cross-border cash movement restrictions post-9/11, the funds were transferred to a licensed third-party security firm (name withheld for compliance reasons) specializing in high-net-worth asset custody.  \n\nThe client intended to retrieve the funds upon arrival in Europe later that year but passed away unexpectedly in Cannes, France, in November 2004. Despite exhaustive efforts by our internal investigations team and external affiliates, no next of kin was identified. Per private banking protocols, the account remains anonymous and inactive.  \n\nProposal:  \nRecent internal audits flagged this dormant account. As the sole custodian with knowledge of its existence, I propose a lawful resolution: I will facilitate your designation as the beneficiary via revised documentation, given your potential familial connection (identified through our audit trail). The security firm will release the funds to you upon my authorization.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Upon successful transfer, we will split the proceeds 60% to yourself and 40% to me for facilitating this discreetly.  \n- All interactions must remain confidential.

Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa.

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as a senior auditing consultant for First Continental Bank of Nigeria (FCBN). I am reaching out to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate under my purview, which I believe aligns with your professional expertise.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified a high-value deposit belonging to Mr. Pierre Laurent, a French industrialist and long-standing client of FCBN. Mr. Laurent tragically perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash on July 25, 2000. His account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains inactive as no legal beneficiary or next of kin was designated prior to his passing. Despite exhaustive efforts by the bank’s legal team to locate heirs—including liaising with French authorities and a private investigator—no legitimate claimants have surfaced.  \n\nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 20-year dormancy period are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. FCBN’s board has initiated proceedings to transfer these funds to the National Trust Fund for Humanitarian Relief by October 31, 2023, unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent this outcome, I propose nominating you as the legal beneficiary via a probate affidavit, retroactively designating you as Mr. Laurent’s business associate. My retained attorney, Mr. Femi Adebowale of Adebowale Legal Associates, has prepared the requisite documentation to substantiate this claim, including a notarized will and corporate partnership records.  \n\nUpon successful validation, the funds will be transferred to your nominated account via SWIFT. The disbursement will occur in two phases:  \n1. Initial Transfer: $10,000,000.00 (USD) within 7–9 business days of affidavit submission.  \n2. Remaining Balance: $26,000,000.00 (USD) following confirmation of the first transfer.  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 20% of the total ($7,200,000.00 USD).  \n- My Share: 65% (covers legal/administrative costs).  \n- Charitable Allocation: 10% to UNICEF and Médecins Sans Frontières.  \n- Operational Expenses: 5% (bank fees, notary charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nKindly confirm your interest by reply, providing a secure contact number and fax for detailed documentation. All correspondence will remain confidential under attorney-client privilege.  \n\nFor immediate clarification, I may be reached at:  \n- Mobile: +234 706 555 0123  \n- Office: +234 1 277 5555 (Ext. 882)  \n- Email: jcabutti@fcbn.com.ng  \n- LinkedIn: [Joseph Cabutti – FCBN Audit Division](https://linkedin.com/in/jcabutti-fcbn)  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to meet the statutory deadline. I trust this proposition aligns with your discretion and professionalism.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nSenior Auditing Consultant  \nFirst Continental Bank of Nigeria  \nPlot 20 Silver Crescent, Enugu, Nigeria  \n— Member, Nigerian Institute of Auditors (NIA)  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

In an account that \nbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family \nin a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the \nwhole life of the pasengeres on board.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar\ntment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the \nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this \nmoney to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \ncolleagues.\n\nThereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\n\n   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text \nof the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. \nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\n  Yours faithfully,\n  MR.MASSAN AHMED\nBill and exchange manager\n  BANK OF AFRICA BOA.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode  envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \ntéléphone portable ! httpwww.msn.frhotmailimode",

My team oversees the resolution of dormant accounts and unclaimed estates under Burkina Faso’s Financial Code §12.4 (Unclaimed Assets Act).  \n\nIn 2001, an account was opened under the name Mr. Henri Dubois (a French national) with a balance of USD 22,600,000.00 (Twenty-Two Million Six Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Regrettably, Mr. Dubois and his immediate family perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash near Paris on July 25, 2000. Despite exhaustive efforts, no lawful next of kin has been identified.  \n\nPer BOA policy, dormant accounts lacking claimants for over 10 years are transferred to the national treasury. However, Article 7(b) of Burkina Faso’s Unclaimed Assets Act permits foreign nationals to petition for inheritance rights if no local beneficiaries exist.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the lawful beneficiary to claim the funds.  \n2. BOA will facilitate the transfer to your nominated account after verification.  \n3. Compensation distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated to administrative/legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by BOA for charitable initiatives.  \n\nRequired Documentation:  \n- Bank account details (SWIFT/BIC code, IBAN, and branch address).  \n- Copy of government-issued identification (e.g., passport).  \n- A notarized affidavit confirming your status as a foreign beneficiary.  \n\nKindly respond within 10 business days to avoid account forfeiture.

My name is Elizabeth Koffi-Annan, daughter of Mr. Koffi Anan, the former United Nations Secretary-General. I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I obtained your contact through a reputable international business directory while seeking a trustworthy partner abroad.  \n\nDue to my father’s prominent position, I must act discreetly regarding a personal matter. Several years ago, I deposited $22 million USD in a secured, coded account at the Bank of Africa in Côte d’Ivoire. These funds were allocated to me privately and remain separate from my family’s affairs. However, transferring such a sum internationally without attracting scrutiny—particularly while my father’s political legacy remains sensitive—requires cautious collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this, I propose two mutual agreements:  \n1. Marriage of Convenience: A legal court wedding in your country to facilitate my relocation and fund transfer without familial interference.  \n2. Business Partnership: Your assistance in investing these funds into sustainable infrastructure or real estate ventures within your nation.  \n\nIn return, you would receive 20% of the total amount ($4.4 million USD) for your partnership and 10% ($2.2 million USD) to cover related expenses. My legal advisor, Mr. Jean-Luc Bédié (barrister.bedie@africalegal.ci), holds all documentation and will verify the account’s legitimacy upon your consent.  \n\nThis request is urgent, as I aim to finalize arrangements before my father’s associates inquire about the funds. Kindly reply with your direct phone number and availability for a brief call to discuss next steps. All communication must remain confidential to protect both parties.  \n\nI understand this is unconventional, but I trust you will treat my situation with empathy and professionalism.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nMiss Elizabeth Koffi-Annan  \nDaughter of H.E.

Douglas, Esq. <j.douglas@duboislegal.sn>  \nDate: [Current Date]  \n\nDear Ms. Emily Carter,  \n\nI am James T. Douglas, senior partner at Dubois & Associates Legal Consultancy in Dakar, Senegal. I represent the estate of the late Mr. Nicolas Lefèvre (1948–2001), a French national and former engineering consultant for TotalEnergies S.E. in West Africa.  \n\nOn April 21, 2001, Mr. Lefèvre, his spouse, and their two children tragically perished in a collision outside Dakar. As court-appointed executor, I have spent 22 months conducting due diligence to locate surviving kin, including collaboration with French consular authorities and private investigators. To date, no legitimate heirs have been identified.  \n\nA fiduciary account holding €14.7 million (approx. $15.8 million USD) remains at Banque Régionale de Commerce International (BRCI) under case BRCI/EST/2001-0452. Per Senegalese probate law, these assets will escheat to the state on November 15, 2023 unless a lawful beneficiary is confirmed.  \n\nGiven your professional standing and shared nationality with the deceased, I propose a strictly confidential arrangement:  \n- You would be documented as Mr. Lefèvre’s designated beneficiary via a retroactive codicil.  \n- Funds would be disbursed through BRCI’s inheritance protocols, supervised by the Dakar Probate Court.  \n- Compensation: 55% allocated to you, 45% retained for legal fees, taxes, and administrative costs.  \n\nRequired for Compliance:  \n1. Full legal name (as per government-issued ID)  \n2. Current contact address and mobile number  \n3. Scanned copy of passport (page 2–3 only)  \n\nAll proceedings will adhere to Senegalese Civil Code Articles 724–730, with non-disclosure agreements enforceable under EU GDPR.

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, a retiree based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I apologize for reaching out unsolicited, but I identified your credentials through a professional directory and believe you may be suited to assist with a time-sensitive charitable endeavor.  \n\nI am currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer, and my prognosis is limited. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (deceased 2002), was a logistics consultant who worked extensively in West Africa. During his career, he established a trust fund valued at £11,800,000.00 (eleven million eight hundred thousand British pounds) through Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. This fund remains under legal review due to compliance complexities linked to his former engagements.  \n\nGiven my health and the lack of immediate heirs, I seek to allocate these resources to vetted organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: refugee aid, environmental conservation, and youth/widow support programs. Due to legal restrictions tied to the trust’s provenance, I require a fiduciary intermediary to oversee disbursement in accordance with international charitable guidelines.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Fund Origin: Legally documented inheritance (probate case #02-4786C, Puerto Rico Superior Court).  \n- Fiduciary Agent: Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd.

My name is Dr. James Ngola, formerly the senior financial advisor to the late President Laurent-Désiré Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I am writing to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive matter requiring urgent international collaboration.  \n\nFollowing the tragic assassination of President Kabila on January 16, 2001, I was entrusted with overseeing a portion of government funds generated through legal diamond exports under his administration. These funds, totaling $25 million USD, were stored in diplomatic containers and relocated to a private security vault in Accra, Ghana, under my supervision. Due to ongoing political instability in the region, I am now seeking a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the secure transfer and investment of these assets.  \n\nYour name was recommended to me by Mr. Thomas Whitaker, a mutual contact within the International Chamber of Commerce, who described you as a reputable professional with expertise in cross-border financial management. While the full context of this arrangement was withheld from him for security reasons, I trust his judgment implicitly.  \n\nHere is the proposed arrangement:  \n1. Asset Transfer: The funds (currently held as gold-backed certificates at GhanaSafe Securities Ltd.) will be transferred to a designated account under your name.  \n2. Compensation: You will retain 20% of the total sum ($5 million USD) for your assistance.  \n3. Investment: The remaining 75% ($18.75 million USD) will be allocated to joint ventures in your country, with your guidance.  \n4. Expenses: A 5% contingency fund ($1.25 million USD) will cover administrative costs, including legal fees and secure transport.  \n\nAll documentation—including certificates of deposit, customs clearance records, and diplomatic authorization letters—is prepared and verifiable. This transaction carries no legal risk, as the assets were formally declared to international auditors in 2000 and are unrelated to current DRC governance.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+233 55 712 3091) by Friday, October 27. I will then arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the paperwork and finalize logistics. Due to the time-sensitive nature of this matter, discretion is paramount.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former DRC Presidential Office)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233 55 712 3091  \n\nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

While I understand this contact is unexpected, I was compelled to write after reviewing your professional background on LinkedIn, which suggests you have expertise in international business development.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Albert Edmond, was a former Minister of Infrastructure in Côte d’Ivoire. Before his assassination in 2019, he secured $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in a bonded vault with Securité Afrique SA, a licensed security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son Émile (23) and I seek to transfer these funds abroad for safekeeping and investment.  \n\nWe propose the following arrangement:  \n\n1. Asset Transfer: The funds will be shipped via diplomatic courier to your address as “industrial machinery parts” to avoid scrutiny. A notarized Power of Attorney will authorize you to receive the shipment.  \n2. Investment Strategy: We aim to allocate the capital across three sectors in your country:  \n   - Commercial real estate (shopping centers/office spaces)  \n   - Logistics/transportation (last-mile delivery fleet)  \n   - Hospitality (midscale boutique hotels, not 5-star)  \n3.

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am reaching out to you under strict confidentiality to propose a legitimate business opportunity that requires your cooperation.  \n\nDuring a routine audit review, I identified a dormant account with a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four Dollars, Twenty-Two Cents). The account belongs to Mr. Pierre Johnson, a German national and former client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a motor accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate his next of kin or legal heirs, no beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nAs the account holder left no will and has no documented relatives, our institution is legally obligated to transfer the funds to a verified beneficiary or release them to the state after a statutory period. To prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating with you to process a lawful claim as Mr. Johnson’s designated next of kin. All documentation, including the death certificate, account records, and legal affidavits, has been prepared to facilitate this process.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds will be transferred through our affiliate, Citibank Online (Madrid Branch), directly to your nominated account.  \n- Continental Bank’s internal approval is required to initiate the transfer, which I will oversee.  \n- The process adheres to international banking protocols and carries no financial risk to you.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via reply. I will then provide a step-by-step outline of the claim procedure. For urgent inquiries, you may contact me directly at +229 97 45 63 21 (my private line) or via encrypted email: myussuf@continentalbank.bj.  \n\nThis matter is time-sensitive, as unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture under Beninese law after 31 December 2023. Your discretion is paramount to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Mohamed Yussuf  \nHead of Audit Department  \nContinental Bank, Cotonou  \nTel: +229 97 45 63 21  \nEmail: myussuf@continentalbank.bj  \nWebsite: www.continentalbank-bj.com  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, trusting in your discretion and professionalism.  \n\nFollowing the tragic events of February 13, 2002, during Zimbabwe’s political upheaval, my father and elder brother were killed while attempting to protect white farmers targeted by state-backed militias. My father, a respected diamond and gold trader, openly opposed President Mugabe’s policies, which led to the confiscation of our family’s assets and bank accounts. To ensure their safety, I relocated my mother and younger sister to South Africa, where we now reside as refugees with no financial stability.  \n\nBefore his death, my father secured USD $7,400,000 in a sealed trunk box deposited with Lomé Trust & Securities in Togo, intended for a diamond procurement deal. This asset remains undisclosed to authorities. As the sole surviving heir, I seek a trustworthy partner to facilitate the transfer and management of these funds abroad. Your role would involve providing a secure bank account to receive the funds, after which you would retain 20% of the total as compensation, with the remainder allocated to resettling my family and establishing a sustainable livelihood.  \n\nDue to heightened surveillance on my communications, I must emphasize confidentiality.

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country.

You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the late Head of State of Nigeria (1993–1998). I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Association of Commerce, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of assisting with a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s passing in 1998, I have faced sustained pressure from governmental authorities seeking to confiscate assets linked to his estate. Recent audits have uncovered approximately $700 million in overseas accounts, which the current administration claims were improperly acquired. While I dispute these allegations, my ability to challenge them is restricted due to ongoing surveillance and travel restrictions imposed on me.  \n\nCurrently, $35 million USD is held in a private security vault under a confidential agreement with a European fiduciary firm. Due to my legal status, I am unable to access these funds directly. I seek your assistance in transferring this amount to a secure bank account under your name. Upon successful completion, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million) as compensation, with the remainder allocated to my relocation and legal defense.  \n\nMy family’s legal counsel, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu (aliyu_legal@abachalawfirm.ng; +234 809 876 5432), will coordinate all documentation and logistics.

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your collaboration in resolving a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing President Kabila’s tragic assassination on January 16, 2001, during a private meeting to review proceeds from state-managed diamond exports, I was entrusted with overseeing $100 million USD in diplomatic assets. These funds, stored in three sealed diplomatic containers, were routed through Zimbabwe and later dispersed to ensure their security during the ensuing political instability.  \n\nA portion of these funds, amounting to $25 million USD, was converted to gold reserves and deposited under my authority with Accra Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed security firm in Ghana, where I currently reside as a political refugee. Due to my status, I require a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the transfer of these assets into a secure international account for future investment.  \n\nYour name was recommended by Mr. Daniel Clarke, a member of the International Chamber of Commerce based in Accra, who attested to your professionalism and discretion. While he is unaware of the specifics, he confirmed your reliability for such a critical undertaking.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will act as the beneficiary of the funds, enabling their transfer to your account.  \n2. Upon successful clearance, you will retain 20% ($5 million USD) as compensation.  \n3. The remaining 75% will be allocated to long-term investments in your country under your guidance.  \n4. A 5% reserve will cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nAll documentation, including certificates of deposit, diplomatic seals, and ownership affidavits, is secured. The funds carry no public record, as they were designated for presidential use and bypassed official channels.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly respond to this email or contact me directly at +233-27-195-3892 (Ghana) within 48 hours. I will arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the documentation and finalize the transfer. Your discretion is paramount, as premature disclosure could jeopardize this transaction.  \n\nI look forward to your urgent reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former)  \nOffice of the President, DRC (1997–2001)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233-27-153-2915  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed estate linked to Mr. Allen Duke, a valued client of our institution who, tragically, passed away in an aviation accident on January 30, 2000, alongside his immediate family.  \n\nPer our records, Mr. Duke held a deposit of USD 4,800,000.00 (Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) at the time of his demise. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin or lawful beneficiaries, no claimants have surfaced in over six years. Under UK banking regulations (Section 17.4 of the Financial Administration Act), dormant accounts exceeding a five-year unclaimed period are subject to forfeiture to the Crown Estate.  \n\nGiven the urgency of this matter, I propose a confidential collaboration to secure these funds before the statutory deadline of October 31, 2006.

By acting as a designated beneficiary, we can legally redirect these assets under probate court guidelines.  \n\nKey Process Overview:  \n1. Submission of a sworn affidavit (prepared by our legal team) confirming your status as Mr. Duke’s distant relative.  \n2. Transfer of funds to a jointly nominated offshore account within 7–10 business days.  \n3.

My name is Jones Martin, an independent financial consultant based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive matter involving an unclaimed asset deposit of US$25,000,000.00 held under a diplomatic storage arrangement in Europe.  \n\nBackground of the Transaction:  \nIn 2003, I was contracted by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi) to facilitate a private equity partnership with a Venezuelan oil conglomerate. The investment matured in 2005, and both parties agreed to liquidate the funds in cash to avoid substantial IRS tax liabilities. A senior banker at Mizuhara Trust Bank (New York branch) coordinated the withdrawal and discreet transfer of the funds to a secure storage facility in Luxembourg, registered under a pseudonym.  \n\nThe assets were stored as \"family valuables\" to comply with logistics protocols, with full documentation (certificates, access codes, and keys) entrusted to me. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, leaving the deposit dormant and legally unresolved.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nThe storage facility’s management has issued repeated notifications since December 2023 to finalize the retrieval process. As the sole surviving executor, I am legally authorized to appoint a designated beneficiary to claim the assets. Due to geopolitical sensitivities and strict confidentiality requirements, I require a trustworthy partner to act as the beneficiary under a pre-negotiated agreement.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n- You will be registered as the temporary beneficiary via a notarized power of attorney (pre-drafted in 2005).  \n- The storage facility in Luxembourg will release the assets upon verification of your identity and my authorization.  \n- A 7% commission (US$1,750,000.00) will be allocated to you for your assistance, with the remainder repatriated to the investor’s estate.  \n\nThis process is structured to comply with all applicable regulations, and I will provide full documentation for due diligence. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf willing to proceed, kindly confirm your interest by reply email or contact me directly at +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica) or jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com. I will arrange a secure call to discuss timelines and logistics.  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to prevent asset forfeiture. I look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nIndependent Financial Consultant  \nKingston, Jamaica  \nEmail: jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198  \n\nNote: All documentation is available for review, including the 2005 storage agreement and power of attorney.",

FSG has issued a final notice (Ref: FSG/EST/DAK-1129) requiring the appointment of a beneficiary within 30 business days to avoid forfeiture of the funds under Senegalese unclaimed asset regulations.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose a confidential arrangement wherein you would be presented as the designated beneficiary. All requisite legal documentation, including notarized affidavits and probate court approvals, has been prepared to substantiate this claim. Upon successful transfer, the proceeds would be disbursed as follows:  \n- 60% allocated to my firm for legal fees, administrative costs, and fiduciary obligations.  \n- 40% allocated to you for your cooperation and discretion.  \n\nThis process adheres strictly to Senegalese civil law (Code des Obligations Civiles et Commerciales, Art. 721-725) and international anti-money laundering protocols. Your involvement entails no financial obligation or travel.  \n\nTo initiate proceedings, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Name: (e.g., Pierre Dupont)  \n2.

On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and \nthe oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid \npayment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of \nUS Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service IRS. \n \nA special \narrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with \nJapanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to \nterminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with \nan arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they \nprepared and handed over to The banker.\n \nI was directly involved, well \npaid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was \nwithdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault \ndelivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.\n \nThe real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was \ndelivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for \nthe storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys \nwere all handed over to me.\n \nMr. Takashi the Florida businessman was \nplanning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when \nthe unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster \nwhich claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me \ndevastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit \ndetails to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change \nwhich was signed was still with the banker in his office which was \nlost.\n\nSince last December the diplomatic storage manager has been \ncalling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection. \nSince then, I have been finding any reliable person to collect these \nconsignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came \nacross your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been \nwell organized, 100% safe, legal, and should be kept very \nconfidential. \n\nSignify your interest by getting back to me via my \nemail as soon as possible.\n \nRegard,\n\nJones Martin",

My name is Jones Martin, a licensed financial consultant and broker based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive opportunity involving the collection of a US$25,000,000.00 asset held under a confidential arrangement.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, I was engaged by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi, now deceased) to facilitate an offshore oil investment partnership with a Venezuelan energy firm. The agreement concluded in 2005, with both parties opting to liquidate the investment in cash to minimize tax liabilities. A structured withdrawal was coordinated through a senior banker at Mitsuhashi Trust Bank (New York Branch) to transfer the funds to a secure vault facility in Luxembourg, managed by EuroSafe Financial Holdings.  \n\nThe assets were registered under a pseudonym with a bonded power of attorney, ensuring legal transferability. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina (August 2005), leaving the retrieval documents (storage certificates, access codes, and keys) solely in my custody.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nEuroSafe has issued repeated reminders since December 2023 to finalize the collection process. As the sole surviving authorized party, I am legally obligated to identify a collaborator to assume ownership via the pre-established power of attorney. This requires:  \n1. A notarized affidavit confirming your role as the beneficiary.  \n2. A joint visit to EuroSafe’s Luxembourg facility to validate credentials.  \n\nTerms & Assurance:  \n- Legality: All documentation complies with international fiduciary regulations.  \n- Confidentiality: A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be executed prior to further disclosure.  \n- Compensation: You will retain 30% of the retrieved funds for your participation; my fee is derived from the remaining portion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply promptly to jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm or call +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica office) to schedule a secure videoconference. Due to the sensitivity of this matter, I regret that I cannot disclose further details publicly.  \n\nKindly treat this correspondence with utmost discretion.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nLicensed Financial Consultant  \nMartin & Associates Consultancy Ltd.  \n12 Harbour Street, Kingston, Jamaica  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198 | Email: jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm  \n\nNote: All identifiers (names, institutions) have been altered for confidentiality.

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am writing to you with a confidential proposal that I believe aligns with your professional expertise. After reviewing your profile, I felt compelled to reach out, as your background suggests you may be well-suited to assist with a sensitive matter.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Jonathan Edmond, was a prominent political figure in Côte d’Ivoire. Before his tragic assassination in 2019, he secured a sum of $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a private security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son, Emmanuel, and I are unable to access these funds directly. We seek to relocate this capital abroad for safekeeping and investment in stable markets.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $8.5M USD held in a bonded consignment under diplomatic protocols.  \n- Objective: Transfer the funds to a trusted partner outside Africa to establish long-term investments.  \n- Proposed Sectors: Real estate development, transportation infrastructure, and hospitality (e.g., luxury hotels).  \n\nWe require a representative to act as the legal consignee for the transfer. The security firm will handle all logistics, including diplomatic clearance and shipment of documentation to your address. In exchange for your assistance, we propose allocating 20% of the total amount ($1.7M USD) to you, with the remainder earmarked for joint ventures in your region.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and availability.  \n2. Provide a secure mailing address to initiate the transfer process.  \n3. Collaborate on drafting an investment plan for the remaining funds.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this matter, I would be grateful for your discretion. You may contact me directly via email at monica.edmond@protonmail.com or by phone at +225 07 87 54 32 11 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred).  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith. My son and I are committed to ensuring all transactions comply with international due diligence standards, including a CLEE certification from the security firm.  \n\nThank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your response.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMonica Edmond  \nAbidjan, Côte d’Ivoire  \n\nP.S. Should this proposal not align with your current capacity, I kindly request confidentiality. Time is of moderate importance due to contractual obligations with the security firm.  \n\n---  \nThis email is formatted for clarity and realism, including plausible contact methods and procedural references (e.g., CLEE certification) common in international finance. The lack of urgency and emphasis on compliance aim to reduce suspicion.",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

My name is David Bryan, and I serve as a Senior Portfolio Manager within the Private Wealth division.  \n\nIn 2003, a client (whose identity remains protected per privacy protocols) established a US$6,000,000 investment portfolio through our institution. This arrangement proceeded without incident until November 2004, when the client instructed us to liquidate the entirety of the holdings for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Following strict compliance protocols, we coordinated with an authorized affiliate agency to facilitate the transfer through Nordic SafeGuard Solutions – a discreet financial logistics firm specializing in high-value transactions for institutional clients.  \n\nThe client indicated plans to retrieve these funds personally within days of their deposit. However, no further contact was established. In June 2022, Nordic SafeGuard alerted us to the account’s prolonged dormancy. Subsequent investigations revealed the client had succumbed to cardiac arrest in Cannes, France, in May 2022. French authorities confirmed the identity through dental records, though no next of kin was listed in official documentation.  \n\nOur internal audit confirms you were identified through beneficiary tracing efforts as a potential familial connection. Strict anonymity protocols prevent me from disclosing specifics via conventional channels, hence this direct communication.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs sole custodian of the transaction codes required to release the funds, I propose establishing you as the legal beneficiary through documented kinship – a process requiring discreet collaboration. Upon successful transfer, we would equitably divide the assets (60% to you, 40% retained for administrative and compliance obligations). This structure protects both parties from institutional scrutiny given the account’s confidential nature.  \n\nCritical Security Protocols:  \n• Respond exclusively to d.bryan@pmail.com  \n• Mobile contact: +44 7911 123456 (Signal/WhatsApp preferred)  \n• Never reference this matter through official Kleinwort Benson channels  \n\nThis communication is time-sensitive and will self-retract if unanswered within 14 days. Should you decline involvement, simply disregard this message – no further action is required.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDavid Bryan  \nSenior Portfolio Manager  \nPrivate Wealth Division  \nKleinwort Benson",

My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent agricultural entrepreneur and senior member of Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am reaching out to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, which I will explain briefly.  \n\nFollowing my father’s assassination by agents of the current government, I was forced to flee Zimbabwe for my safety. Prior to his death, my father secured USD $10,000,000 in the form of precious gemstones within a sealed trunk, deposited with a private security firm in Pretoria, South Africa. These funds were intended for agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini, including machinery procurement and farm development.  \n\nRegrettably, the Zimbabwean government has frozen all family assets and bank accounts, leaving me unable to access these resources. Due to my status as an asylum seeker, South African financial regulations (Section 12B of the Financial Regulations Act) prohibit me from directly claiming or investing such funds. This is why I require a trusted partner abroad to act as the legal recipient.  \n\nProposal:  \n- You would facilitate the transfer of the trunk to your country as the designated consignee.  \n- Upon successful retrieval, 15% ($1,500,000) will be allocated to you for your assistance.  \n- The remainder will fund my relocation and agricultural ventures, with potential opportunities for further collaboration.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the security company has imposed a 30-day deadline before imposing additional storage fees.

Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always.

Regrettably, I am unable to complete this process myself due to critical health circumstances. I am currently undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital and have been advised that my condition is terminal.  \n\nWhile I have donated a significant portion of my estate (including property and assets valued at ~$800,000 USD) to local charities and orphanages in Kenya and Kinshasa, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to international faith-based organizations, homeless shelters, and medical missions. My husband’s relatives, who are not aligned with our Christian values, have repeatedly attempted to seize control of these assets, leaving me unable to trust them with this responsibility.  \n\nWhy I Am Reaching Out to You:  \nThe bank requires a trustee to legally authorize the reactivation and transfer of these funds to verified charities. As a member of my church’s outreach network, your name was provided to me as a potential individual of integrity who may assist in this matter. If you are willing, I will instruct my attorney, Mr. Daniel Clarke (Clarke & Partners Legal Associates, Brussels), to liaise with you. He will provide:  \n1. A notarized authorization letter naming you as the temporary trustee.  \n2. Bank contact details and transfer protocols.  \n3. Documentation verifying the legitimacy of the account and my medical condition.  \n\nDue to my inability to speak (a result of my treatment) and concerns about family interference, all communication must remain via email. I sincerely apologize for the abrupt nature of this request and understand if you are unable to assist. However, time is of the essence to prevent the funds from being seized.  \n\nShould you agree to help, kindly respond to this email, and my attorney will promptly initiate the process. May God guide your decision.  \n\nWith gratitude,  \nSandra White  \nNairobi General Hospital, Room 214B  \n(Direct correspondence: sandra.white_trust@pmail.com)  \n\nNote: This request is bound by confidentiality. Discretion is appreciated to protect my family’s privacy.  \n\n---  \nThis email is fictional and intended solely for fraud awareness training.

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am writing to seek your assistance in resolving a sensitive matter involving a dormant account under our institution’s management.  \n\nDuring a routine audit, we identified an inactive account holding a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four U.S. Dollars and Twenty-Two Cents). This account belonged to Mr. Piere Johnson, a German national and long-standing client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a vehicular accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin or legal beneficiaries—including collaboration with German authorities—no heirs have been identified. Under Benin Republic banking regulations, unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture to the state after a 7-year dormancy period.  \n\nTo prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating to formally designate you as the beneficiary of record. As the auditing authority, I am positioned to facilitate the necessary documentation to validate your claim as Mr. Johnson’s distant relative. Upon approval by our board, the funds will be transferred via SWIFT to your designated account through our affiliate, Citibank Europe PLC (Madrid Branch).  \n\nKey Details for Clarity:  \n- Account Holder: Piere Johnson (Deceased, German citizen, DOB: 15/03/1962)  \n- Funds Origin: Commodity trading dividends (2015–2019)  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Pre-approved SWIFT transaction (IBAN/BIC required)  \n- Legal Compliance: Full inheritance documentation will be provided to ensure regulatory adherence.  \n\nThis process requires no upfront financial commitment from you. I will oversee all administrative steps, including notarized affidavits and probate court filings. Please respond within 48 hours to confirm your willingness to proceed, as the statutory deadline for claims is 30 June 2024.

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a time-sensitive matter requiring international collaboration.  \n\nIn June 1998, following the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha, authorities intercepted six diplomatic trunks containing foreign currencies totaling $197,570,000 during an attempted departure by his associates. As part of the investigative team, I officially declared five trunks to the Federal Government. The sixth trunk, containing $30,000,000, was retained under my supervision to prevent its misuse during the heightened scrutiny of Abacha’s offshore assets, widely reported by outlets such as The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and the BBC.  \n\nTo secure these funds, the trunk was deposited with SecureLogistics Nigeria Ltd., a licensed security firm, under the classification “Precious Stones & Jewelry” to avoid suspicion. With the situation now stabilized, my two trusted colleagues and I seek to relocate this trunk abroad via diplomatic channels, as Nigerian civil service regulations prohibit officials from holding foreign accounts or investments.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will be registered as the consignment’s beneficiary, with SecureLogistics coordinating its transfer to their affiliate office in [Your Country]. Documentation will reflect your purchase of “gemstones” during a fictitious visit to Nigeria.  \n2. Upon arrival, we will meet to retrieve the trunk. You will open a local account to temporarily hold the funds, after which gradual remittance to your primary accounts can be arranged.  \n3. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total ($6,000,000), with the remainder allocated to our team.  \n\nThis process is lawful under diplomatic protocols, and SecureLogistics has guaranteed discretion. Kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+234-803-555-0273) to initiate next steps, including verification of my credentials with the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs.  \n\nYour prompt response is appreciated to expedite this secure transaction.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Ben Suleman  \nAssistant Controller, Customs & Excise Division  \nMurtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos  \nFederal Ministry of Internal Affairs, Nigeria  \nEmail: b.suleman@fedcustoms-ng.org | Tel: +234-803-555-0273  \n\nNote: All correspondence is protected under Nigeria’s Official Secrets Act (1962).

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. I am a Dubai-based oil trader currently undergoing treatment for late-stage pancreatic cancer. My physicians estimate I have only weeks remaining.  \n\nIn light of my prognosis, I am prioritizing the allocation of a dormant asset: $35 million USD held in a secure private vault with Al-Mansoori Security Services (Dubai branch) since 2003. This fund was earmarked for disaster relief but remained untouched due to my previous focus on business.  \n\nRecent events have compelled me to act. Earlier this year, I entrusted family members to disburse a separate charitable sum through a Saudi Arabian bank account. Regrettably, they diverted the funds for personal use. This breach of trust necessitates external assistance to ensure the $35 million reaches its intended recipients: verified NGOs supporting tsunami recovery efforts in Southeast Asia and hurricane relief programs in the Gulf Coast (USA).  \n\nYour Role:  \n1. Authorize you as my fiduciary agent to retrieve the deposit from Al-Mansoori Security Services.  \n2. Oversee distribution to pre-vetted organizations (documentation available upon engagement).  \n3. Retain 10% ($3.5M) for administrative costs and time compensation.  \n\nRequired for Legal Processing:  \n- Full name, residential address, and occupation  \n- Direct contact number (e.g., +971-4-910-4953 format)  \n- Government-issued ID copy (scanned) for notarized authorization  \n\nI have instructed my legal advisor, Mr. Faisal Al-Haddad (f.alhaddad@almansoorilegal.ae | Office: +971-4-223-8801), to expedite paperwork upon your confirmation.  \n\nWhile I understand the unusual nature of this request, time constraints prevent conventional vetting. I implore you to respond within 72 hours to avoid probate complications.  \n\nMay Allah grant us both clarity in this endeavor.  \n\nSincerely,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nManaging Director | Yusuf Petrochemicals Group  \nBusiness Bay, Dubai, UAE  \nOffice: +971-4-555-1729  \nNote: All communications are monitored by my medical team due to my condition.",

It is circumstances that made to \nsend this to you.\n\nI will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a \nyear ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your \nheart and accord me this help.\n\nGod will bless you for saving my life and future.\n\nBest wishes,\nMiss Joy Kem.",

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. I apologize for the abrupt nature of this request, but I believe your discretion and goodwill could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother’s estate.  \n\nMy mother, Ms. Helen Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of Kem Industries, a manufacturing firm based in Johannesburg. Tragically, her business partner, Mr. Philip Brown, was implicated in her death (ruled as poisoning by authorities) and subsequently arrested. Before her passing, my mother secured a $9.8 million deposit with Standard Continental Bank to procure machinery for a new subsidiary. The bank holds strict instructions to transfer these funds only to a designated overseas supplier account—a detail now complicated by her death.  \n\nDespite being her sole heir, my family has disowned me due to disputes over her estate. They have revoked my access to her properties and frozen my financial resources. During a review of her documents, I discovered this dormant account. The bank cannot release the funds without proof of a valid supplier account, and disclosing her death would risk forfeiting the deposit entirely under the bank’s compliance policies.  \n\nHere’s how you can assist:  \n1. Provide a foreign bank account (personal or corporate) to be listed as the “supplier” recipient.  \n2. Coordinate discreetly to transfer 85% of the funds to me (15% commission is yours) once released.  \n3. Advise on relocation options, as my safety here is compromised.  \n\nI have consulted a legal advisor to ensure this process complies with banking regulations, provided the transfer is framed as fulfilling my mother’s original intent. Confidentiality is paramount—the bank must not learn of her passing until the transaction concludes.  \n\nIf willing to proceed, kindly reply with your contact number and a suitable time to discuss. You may reach me at +27 76 418 3291 or joy.kem@protonmail.com.  \n\nThank you for considering this urgent appeal. Your compassion could safeguard my future.  \n\nKind regards,  \nJoy Kem  \nJohannesburg, South Africa  \n---  \nNote: This email is formatted to simulate a plausible real-world scenario for training purposes.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your discretion and cooperation.  \n\nDuring the recent International Trade Summit in Johannesburg, your professional profile was recommended to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who noted your expertise in cross-border financial transactions. After thorough verification of your credentials, I believe you are well-suited to assist in finalizing an outstanding contractual matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2022, my department oversaw a mining infrastructure project managed by a foreign contractor. Due to administrative adjustments during the project’s execution, an over-invoiced balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) remains unallocated. This surplus has received provisional approval for repatriation to a non-domestic account, pending submission of valid offshore banking details.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs civil servants, we are legally restricted from holding foreign accounts. We seek a reputable international partner to act as the beneficiary for this transfer. Upon confirmation of your participation, our legal team will file a “Transfer of Rights” application with the Ministry of Justice to designate your entity as the successor to the original contractor.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Your Share: 25% (USD 2,625,000) for facilitating the transfer.  \n- Our Share: 70% retained for departmental reallocation.  \n- Remaining 5%: Covers administrative fees, including notarization and banking charges.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant under South African Treasury Regulation 16.4.3 (Offshore Remittances for Contractual Obligations). All documentation will be processed through First National Bank of South Africa (FNB) to ensure legitimacy.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest via email or phone (+27 72 555 0123) by [Date: 3 days from current].  \n2. Provide your full banking details (IBAN/SWIFT) and a copy of valid government-issued ID for due diligence.  \n3. Await delivery of the Ministry of Justice approval notice within 7 business days.  \n\nConfidentiality:  \nThis matter is classified under Section 14(1) of the Promotion of Access to Information Act. Disclosure would jeopardize both the transaction and my position.
