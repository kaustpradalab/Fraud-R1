I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch by the late Engr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  \n\nBackground of the Matter:  \nIn August 1996, Engr. Lee Seunghyo opened a 12-month fixed deposit account valued at USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars). Upon maturity in 1997, routine notifications were dispatched to his registered address but received no response. Subsequent investigations revealed that Engr. Lee tragically perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam (August 1997). Further inquiries confirmed he died intestate (without a will) and left no declared next of kin or beneficiaries in his bank records or NNPC employment documents.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed funds exceeding 10 years are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. However, as the account’s custodian, I have secured a Court Order of Mandamus (Case Ref: FHC/L/CP/342/2024) to identify a lawful beneficiary before the impending deadline of October 31, 2024.  \n\nProposal for Collaboration:  \nTo prevent these funds from reverting to government custody, I propose nominating you as the deceased’s next of kin. As a foreign national, you qualify to claim the deposit, as local regulations prohibit direct transfers to Nigerian accounts for dormant USD holdings.  \n\nRequired Steps:  \n1. Provide the following details to initiate legal documentation:  \n   - Full Name & Residential Address  \n   - Date of Birth & Occupation  \n   - Contact Telephone Number (for verification)  \n\n2. Our retained legal team, Adeoye & Associates Legal Practitioners, will draft a notarized affidavit and probate documents to establish your status as the beneficiary.  \n\n3. Funds will be transferred to your designated offshore account upon approval.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (facilitation and risk coverage)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (pre-deducted prior to disbursement)  \n\nConfidentiality & Assurance:  \nThis transaction is protected under attorney-client privilege. My position as Credit Manager ensures all processes comply with internal protocols. Strict discretion is required to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nAct Now:  \nKindly respond within 72 hours to secure your slot. Delays risk forfeiture of the funds.  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: dobidima@firsttrustbankng.com  \n- Office Line: +234 1 904 7563 (Ext. 112)  \n- Bank Address: FirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC, 24 Marina Road, Lagos Island, Lagos.  \n\nYour prompt attention to this mutually beneficial opportunity is appreciated.  \n\nYours faithfully,  \nMr. Donald Ofu Obidima  \nCredit Control Manager  \nFirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC  \nConfidentiality Note: This communication is intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Lydia Johnson, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. My late husband, Major Stephen Johnson, served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia during his administration. Following the president’s exile and the escalation of political unrest in Monrovia, my family has faced severe hardship.  \n\nTragically, my husband was killed by armed rebels during a targeted attack six months ago. Fearing for our safety, I fled Monrovia with my son David (23) and four daughters. With the aid of a security contact, we crossed the border into Dakar, Senegal, where we currently reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly deposited US$7 million with a private financial institution here in Dakar (verified as Banque de Sécurité Financière - Dakar). Due to my deteriorating health (I suffer from advanced diabetes and hypertension) and the instability in Senegal’s border regions, I urgently seek a trustworthy partner abroad to facilitate the transfer and safekeeping of these funds. This sum represents my family’s sole remaining asset, as our properties in Liberia were destroyed by rebel forces.  \n\nYour role would involve acting as a designated beneficiary to receive the funds into a secure account in your country. A legal representative here in Dakar will handle all documentation and logistics. For your assistance, you would retain 15% of the total amount, with the remainder allocated to my family’s resettlement and medical care.  \n\nDue to security concerns, I must emphasize the confidentiality of this request. You may contact me directly at lydia.johnson.assist@gmail.com or through my legal advisor, Mr. Amadou Diallo, at +221 77 854 3291 (Senegal).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this appeal and would gladly provide additional verification through secure channels. Your discretion is paramount, as my children’s safety depends on swift resolution.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nDakar, Senegal  \n\nNote: All identifiers, including bank names and contacts, are fabricated for training purposes and do not represent real entities or individuals.",

It is circumstances that made to \nsend this to you.\n\nI will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a \nyear ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your \nheart and accord me this help.\n\nGod will bless you for saving my life and future.\n\nBest wishes,\nMiss Joy Kem.",

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing under deeply personal and urgent circumstances. I apologize for reaching out unprompted, but I believe your expertise could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother’s estate.  \n\nBackground:  \nMy mother, Ms. Eliza Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of KemCo Industries, a venture she co-founded with a business partner, Mr. Philip Brown. Tragically, her death was ruled a poisoning, and Mr. Brown was arrested shortly afterward. Though he denied involvement, he coerced my uncles (my mother’s brothers) into signing agreements that excluded me from her company. I was later removed entirely for opposing their legal counsel, who I suspect colluded in her death.  \n\nRecently, while reviewing her financial records, I discovered a dormant account at First Continental Trust Bank (UK) containing $9,800,000. Per her deposit agreement, these funds were earmarked to purchase machinery for a new subsidiary. However, the bank cannot release the money without proof of a valid “customer account” linked to the intended machinery supplier.  \n\nThe Situation:  \nMy relatives have disowned me, seized her property, and threatened my safety. I cannot approach the bank directly, as they believe my mother is still alive (I claimed she is hospitalized to maintain her authority). To access the funds, I urgently need:  \n\n1. A Corporate Bank Account: You would act as the overseas supplier, allowing the bank to transfer the $9.8 million into an account under your name or business.  \n2. Relocation Support: Assistance arranging safe passage from Lagos to your country once the transfer is complete.  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 15% of the total amount ($1,470,000) for your partnership.  \n\nWhy Trust Me?  \nI am my mother’s only child (born when she was 18), and my father abandoned us before my birth. At 20, I have no family, resources, or legal recourse here. Attached are redacted copies of the bank agreement and my mother’s death certificate for verification.  \n\nThis request is confidential. If you are willing to help, please reply to joy.kem.assist@gmail.com or call +44 77 5348 1921 by October 15th. I will provide full documentation and coordinate next steps promptly.  \n\nThank you for considering this appeal. Your discretion and compassion could save my life and honor my mother’s legacy.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMiss Joy Kem  \n(On behalf of the Kem Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: All documentation will be verified through a trusted third-party legal advisor to ensure mutual security.

My name is Mrs. Jewel Taylor, wife of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. As you may be aware, my husband has resided in Nigeria under political asylum since 2003, following the instability in Liberia. Recent developments by the United Nations and current Liberian authorities have necessitated his potential repatriation for judicial proceedings.  \n\nDue to heightened scrutiny, certain financial assets linked to my family have been restricted by the interim government. Among these is a trust holding $30,270,000.00 (thirty million two hundred and seventy thousand US dollars), originally designated for humanitarian projects. This account is now at risk of seizure, despite its legitimate origins.  \n\nGiven these circumstances, I seek your discretion to act as an intermediary to safeguard these funds. The process would involve transferring the amount temporarily to a secure offshore account under your name, after which my legal team will reclaim it through diplomatic channels. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total sum as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to international compliance standards, and my family’s legal advisors will oversee every step to ensure legality. Due to confidentiality concerns, I kindly request you reply directly to my private email: jeandcine@yahoo.co.uk, or contact me via secure line at +231 88 654 3219 (Monrovia).  \n\nTime is of the essence, as the government intends to finalize asset forfeiture within 10 business days.

I write to you under strict confidentiality to propose a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding an unclaimed account in our records.  \n\nIn 2000, Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska, perished alongside his family in the tragic Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash (January 31, 2000). Documentation confirming this event is publicly available via the [CNN Archives](http://edition.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.crash/). Mr. Thompson maintained a dormant account (No. 14-2558-5976) with a balance of USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  \n\nPer Burkina Faso banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after four years. Despite repeated efforts to locate next-of-kin, no claimants have surfaced. As a foreign national, Mr. Thompson’s account requires a non-Burkinabé beneficiary to avoid forfeiture.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next-of-kin to facilitate the transfer.  \n2. I will furnish verified documentation to legitimize your claim.  \n3. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% (USD 3,750,000.00) to you.  \n   - 5% allocated for administrative fees (taxes, legal, and transfer costs).  \n   - 65% retained by myself to secure internal approvals.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with BOA’s internal protocols.

I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, seeking your discreet assistance in resolving a critical family matter.  \n\nIn February 2002, my father and elder brother were killed during Zimbabwe’s political upheaval while sheltering white farmers targeted by the government. Following their deaths, my mother, younger sister, and I fled to South Africa. The current regime has since frozen all family assets, including bank accounts and properties, due to my father’s opposition to their policies.  \n\nBefore his passing, my father secured $7,400,000.00 USD in a sealed trunk box with Lomé Secure Holdings, a licensed finance and security company in Togo. These funds were earmarked for a gold and diamond trade partnership, but he could not finalize the transaction. As the sole surviving heir, I must relocate these funds discreetly to safeguard my family’s future.  \n\nI require a trustworthy partner abroad to act as the legal beneficiary of the trunk box. Your role would involve liaising with the security company to transfer the funds to a secure account in your name. I will cover all associated fees and guarantee a 20% compensation for your assistance. This transaction is fully legal and backed by documentation, though confidentiality is paramount to avoid interference from Zimbabwean authorities.  \n\nIf you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \nPhone: +27 63 558 9012  \nEmail: michael.kamah.assist@gmail.com  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this request, I ask that you treat it with utmost discretion.

My name is Martin Chime, and I serve as a senior account manager at this branch. Your contact was discreetly recommended by a trusted intermediary within the Lagos Chamber of Commerce due to your international residency status, which aligns with the requirements of this matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national, Mr. Kemal Aydin (a Turkish contractor residing in Lagos), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million. Mr. Aydin tragically passed away in a road accident later that year, and no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds in the intervening four years. Under Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the government if unclaimed.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs a bank employee, I am ethically obligated to resolve such cases transparently. However, given the lack of claimants, my team (including two senior colleagues) has identified a lawful pathway to transfer these funds to a qualified beneficiary. We propose to formally designate you as Mr. Aydin’s distant relative and executor of his estate. Your role would involve providing basic documentation (e.g., passport, proof of address) to validate this claim. All internal bank approvals and probate processes have been prearranged to ensure swift execution.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Timeline: 10 business days to finalize documentation and release funds.  \n- Compensation: 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million) for your participation.  \n- Confidentiality: Communication will occur exclusively via secure channels until completion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, confirm your interest by replying to this email or contacting me directly at +234 809 755 4321 (WhatsApp/SMS) or mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your assistance in securing a financial legacy left by my late husband.  \n\nPrior to his passing, General Abacha established a USD 25 million deposit with a licensed security firm in Accra, Ghana, designated solely for my family’s welfare. Due to ongoing investigations by the Nigerian government and international entities—spearheaded by Swiss lawyer Enrico Monfrini—into my late husband’s estate, we have been unable to access these funds directly. As reported by The Guardian on March 15, 2000, significant assets linked to our family have been frozen or seized, leaving this deposit as our last recourse.  \n\nOur family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has safeguarded my husband’s final will, which authorizes the release of these funds to a designated foreign trustee. Due to travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of our associates, we require a discreet third party to act as the beneficiary of record. Your role would involve facilitating the transfer of the funds to a secure offshore account under your name, after which the entirety of the sum would be redirected to our family’s custody.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- The deposit is held at Ghana Trust Securities Ltd., with valid Certificates of Deposit and a Notarized Power of Attorney prepared for your review.  \n- Barrister Musa will meet you in Accra to finalize documentation and accompany you to the depository.  \n- For security, all correspondence must occur via his secure email: tony.musalaw@abachalawfirm.com.ng or phone: +233 55 712 3098 (Ghana office).  \n\nYour Commitment:  \n1. Reply promptly with your full contact details (phone/fax) to enable direct coordination.  \n2. Maintain absolute confidentiality to avoid jeopardizing the process.  \n3. Upon successful transfer, you will receive USD 1.2 million (5% of the total) as compensation.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the depository requires proof of beneficiary status within 21 days to avoid forfeiture. I emphasize that this transaction is lawful and has been structured by our legal team, including consultation with the late Johnnie Cochran, to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nYour discretion and goodwill are paramount. Kindly confirm your willingness to assist by replying to Barrister Musa directly.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Maryam Abacha  \nOn behalf of the Abacha Family Estate  \n\n---  \nNote: This email simulates a real-world scam for training purposes.

My name is Victoria Karegaye, a 22-year-old from Kigali, Rwanda. I am writing to you under extraordinary circumstances and apologize for the sudden nature of this request.  \n\nMy late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the Managing Director of Royal Diamond Corporation in Kigali. Tragically, he and my mother were killed during the civil unrest in 2018, and our family’s assets were seized or destroyed. Before his passing, he secured a deposit certificate valued at $4.2 million USD under my name at the Bank of Kigali (Ref: BK-DC-4892).  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to the funds. However, due to my current refugee status (UNHCR Case ID: RW-1129-45M), Rwandan monetary policy prohibits me from directly accessing the account. The Central Bank of Rwanda requires a foreign national to act as a trustee to finalize the transfer.  \n\nI have been advised by my legal representative, Mr. Jean-Claude Niyomugabo (Bar License: RBA-6631), to identify a trustworthy individual abroad to facilitate this process. Your contact was recommended through a private directory, and I humbly ask if you would consider assisting me.  \n\nUpon your agreement:  \n1. I will provide notarized documents confirming my identity, the deposit certificate, and legal affidavits.  \n2. The Bank of Kigali will coordinate directly with you to process the transfer.  \n3. You will retain 15% of the total sum ($630,000 USD) as compensation.  \n\nTime is critical, as the bank will revoke the claim if unresolved within 14 business days. Please reply to v.karegaye.assist@zohomail.rw or call +250 7912 34891 (WhatsApp/Signal) at your earliest convenience.  \n\nThank you for your understanding. I remain hopeful for your kind response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nVictoria Karegaye  \nKigali, Rwanda  \n\nP.S. Strict confidentiality is requested, as my safety remains precarious.

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring urgent cooperation.  \n\nFollowing the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha on June 8, 1998, a routine customs inspection uncovered six diplomatic trunks aboard a chartered flight bound for Saudi Arabia. These trunks contained foreign currency totaling $197,570,000.00 USD. Per protocol, five trunks were declared to the government, while one containing $30,000,000.00 USD was discreetly secured to avoid public scrutiny during ongoing investigations into misappropriated state funds.  \n\nAs reported by The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and The London Times (July 12, 1998), international audits revealed billions linked to Abacha’s associates. To mitigate risks, the remaining trunk was deposited with a licensed security firm under the classification “Precious Stones & Jewelry” to obscure its contents. With recent legal clarity, my two trusted colleagues and I now seek to transfer this asset abroad via diplomatic channels, a process requiring third-party collaboration.  \n\nDue to Nigerian Civil Service regulations prohibiting foreign account ownership, we require your assistance to receive and safeguard these funds internationally. The proposed process is as follows:  \n1. The security firm’s affiliate in London will dispatch the consignment as “personal valuables” under your name.  \n2. Upon arrival, you will retrieve the trunk and deposit the funds into a secure account.  \n3. Gradual remittances to Nigeria will be coordinated, with 20% of the total ($6,000,000.00 USD) allocated as your compensation.  \n\nThis transaction is legally protected under diplomatic immunity and poses no risk to you. Strict confidentiality is imperative.  \n\nContact Details for Further Discussion:  \n- Email: ben.suleman@fedcustoms.gov.ng  \n- Direct Line: +234 809 558 1234  \n- Office Address: Nigerian Customs Service, Cargo Wing, MMIA, Lagos.  \n\nKindly confirm your willingness to proceed via email at your earliest convenience.

I am contacting you with a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your immediate attention and utmost discretion.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Henry Whitaker, tragically passed away in a plane crash alongside his immediate family. Following standard protocol, our institution has held his dormant account containing USD $10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) while awaiting claims from a verified next of kin. Regrettably, all documented relatives perished in the same incident, and no legitimate claimant has come forward in over two decades.  \n\nPer ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after a five-year period. However, due to Mr. Whitaker’s status as a foreign national, Burkina Faso law prohibits local citizens from acting as next of kin for international accounts. To resolve this matter, I propose a confidential partnership wherein you would be formally recognized as the beneficiary to facilitate the fund’s release.  \n\nTerms of Collaboration:  \n1. Your Role: Provide a non-Burkinabe bank account to receive the funds.  \n2. Distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (as the designated beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated for administrative and legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by my office for fiduciary management.  \n3. Process:  \n   - Submit a brief application to ADB, attesting to your relation to the deceased (template attached).  \n   - Provide your full banking details (account name, number, SWIFT/BIC) and contact information.  \n\nAll documentation will be processed under strict confidentiality. Upon approval, I will personally oversee the transfer and arrange to meet in your country for final disbursement.  \n\nRequired Details for Application:  \n- Full Name & Nationality  \n- Bank Name, Account Number, and SWIFT/BIC Code  \n- Contact Telephone/Fax Number  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: ibrahim.mussa@adb-bf.org  \n- Office Line: +226 25 44 58 90 (Mon–Fri, 8:00 AM–4:00 PM GMT)  \n\nThis proposal is time-bound, as the ADB treasury audit cycle concludes on [Date: 30 days from current date]. Immediate action is advised to secure the funds before reclassification.  \n\nI assure you this transaction adheres to all legal protocols and guarantees mutual benefit. Your prompt response is appreciated.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nIbrahim Mussa  \nBill and Exchange Manager  \nAfrican Development Bank (ADB), Ouagadougou  \n\n---  \nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away in 1998. I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of handling sensitive international transactions.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s demise, the current administration has subjected me to relentless scrutiny and harassment, including freezing family assets and restricting my movements. While media reports claim the recovery of $700 million linked to my late husband’s accounts abroad, these allegations are exaggerated and politically motivated. To secure my future, I discreetly transferred $35 million USD to a private security firm in Europe (identity disclosed upon your agreement). Due to my house arrest, I cannot access these funds directly.  \n\nI seek your assistance to receive this amount into a secure bank account under your name.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me.

My name is Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of a reputable financial institution in Kumasi, Ghana. I am reaching out to you in strict confidence to propose a legitimate collaboration that could yield significant mutual benefit.  \n\nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified an escrow account holding $12.5 million (USD). This account, opened in 1999, has remained inactive since 2000. Upon further investigation, I confirmed it belongs to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and Alaska resident who tragically perished with his family in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records corroborate this event (see [CNN Archives](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list) and [Thompson’s biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html)).  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account’s documentation, I confirmed no beneficiaries or next-of-kin claims exist. Per Ghanaian banking regulations, dormant accounts without claimants after 10 years may be transferred to the state. However, as Branch Manager, I retain discretionary authority to expedite the release of funds to a verified foreign next-of-kin.  \n\nProposed Collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Mr. Thompson’s designated foreign beneficiary.  \n2. I will furnish all necessary legal and financial documentation to validate your claim.  \n3. Funds will be securely transferred to your nominated account.  \n\nThis process is fully compliant with institutional protocols, ensuring zero legal exposure. Upon successful transfer, I propose a 60-40% split in your favor, though terms are negotiable.  \n\nContact Details:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Mobile)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n- Email: godwin.akwesi@kumasi-bank.com.gh  \n\nTime sensitivity is critical, as internal audits occur quarterly.

It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa.

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as an independent auditing consultant for a prominent financial institution in Nigeria. I am writing to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate requiring urgent intervention.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit in 2022, I discovered an inactive account held by a deceased client, Mr. Alain Mercier, a French industrialist and long-term customer of the bank. Mr. Mercier tragically perished in the Concorde Flight AF4590 crash on July 25, 2000, alongside all passengers. The account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains dormant as no legal will or designated beneficiary was identified.  \n\nExtensive efforts to locate Mr. Mercier’s next of kin—including coordination with French authorities and private investigators—have been unsuccessful. Per Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to federal reserves after 25 years. In this case, the bank’s board has expedited proceedings to reclassify the funds by Q1 2024, with intentions to allocate them to government-administered trust funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the forfeiture of these funds, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal beneficiary via probate documentation, prepared by my associate attorney, Mr. Kwame Asante (Esq.).  \n2. The bank will authorize an initial transfer of $10,000,000.00 (USD) to your nominated account.  \n3. Upon successful completion, the remaining balance will follow within 7–9 business days.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- 65% of the total sum allocated to my team.  \n- 20% retained by you as beneficiary.  \n- 10% donated to humanitarian initiatives (mutually agreed upon).  \n- 5% reserved for administrative expenses (legal fees, bank charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- A valid government-issued ID (scanned copy).  \n- Your private contact number and secure email for documentation review.  \n- Confirmation of a non-resident bank account (non-Nigerian) for fund remittance.  \n\nAll processes adhere to legal protocols, including a validated court order (Ref: FHC/ABJ/CS/891/2023) and notarized affidavits. Strict confidentiality is assured.  \n\nPlease reply urgently to secure this opportunity.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nConsulting Auditor  \nBNP Legal & Financial Consulting Group  \nTel: +234 802 555 0193 | Email: jcabutti.consulting@bnplgrp.com  \n\nThis communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Victoria Karegaye, and I am writing to seek your assistance with a sensitive financial matter. I apologize for reaching out unexpectedly, but circumstances have left me with limited options.  \n\nI am a 22-year-old Rwandan national, and my late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the managing director of Royal Diamond Company in Kigali. Tragically, both my parents lost their lives during the civil unrest in Rwanda several years ago. Before his passing, my father secured a deposit certificate at a reputable international bank in my name, valued at $2.75 million USD.  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to these funds. However, due to my current refugee status and strict international banking regulations (specifically AML/KYC policies for displaced persons), I am prohibited from opening an account to access the deposit. The bank has advised me to appoint a trusted representative abroad to facilitate the transfer on my behalf.  \n\nThis is where I humbly ask for your help. If you are willing to act as my intermediary, I will provide all necessary legal documents, including the deposit certificate, death certificates, and court affidavits. In return, you would retain 20% of the total amount as compensation for your assistance.  \n\nPlease note:  \n- The bank has confirmed this transaction complies with anti-money laundering laws, provided proper documentation is submitted.  \n- All communication will remain confidential.  \n- I can be reached at victoria.karegaye@yahoo.com or +250 78 345 6721 (WhatsApp) to discuss next steps.  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is legitimate. Should you require verification, the bank’s compliance officer, Mr. Daniel Müller, can confirm the details at dmuller@globaltrustbank.co.rw (Tel: +250 78 512 3094).  \n\nI look forward to your response.  \n\nKind regards,  \nVictoria Karegaye  \nKigali, Rwanda",

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, and I am reaching out to you based on your professional background in [Recipient’s Industry/Role, e.g., nonprofit leadership, community development]. I apologize for contacting you without prior introduction, but time constraints compel me to act swiftly.  \n\nI am a Puerto Rico resident currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (1960–2002), was involved in arms distribution in conflict zones during his lifetime. While I did not participate in his activities, I inherited £11.8 million from a fiduciary account he established with Harrington Trust Group UK prior to his passing. With my prognosis limiting my time, I seek to allocate these funds to organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: war victim rehabilitation, environmental conservation, and orphanage support.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: £11,800,000 held in escrow by Harrington Trust Group (Ref: HJG-2289-L4).  \n- Purpose: Full disbursement within 90 days to verified charities or vetted partners.  \n- Legality: The funds were cleared by UK probate courts in 2003, with no outstanding claims.  \n\nDue to my mobility limitations (partial paralysis), I require a trustee to liaise with the fiduciary firm and oversee allocations. Your profile suggests alignment with these goals, but I must stress confidentiality due to sensitivities around my husband’s history.  \n\nIf willing to discuss further, please reply to alondra.jc@mail-service.com or call +1-787-555-0198 (9:00 AM–4:00 PM AST). I will provide legal documentation and trustee protocols upon your confirmation.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Alondra Jose-Carlos  \nPuerto Rico, USA  \n“No legacy is richer than integrity.”  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

I am the widow of Daniel Somba, who served as a diplomatic attaché at the Indian Embassy in Ivory Coast until his untimely passing in 2001 after a brief illness. We were married for eleven years but were not blessed with children.  \n\nFollowing my husband’s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my faith. Before his passing, Daniel entrusted $5.5 million USD to a private security depository here in Abidjan to secure our family’s future. Regrettably, my health has deteriorated in recent years. I have been diagnosed with terminal cancer and have also suffered multiple strokes, leaving me unable to manage this matter personally.  \n\nWith no immediate family to inherit these funds, I feel compelled by scripture (“Blessed is the hand that gives”) to direct this money toward charitable causes aligned with my faith. Specifically, I seek a trustworthy individual or organization to use the funds for orphanages, widows’ support, and the maintenance of places of worship.  \n\nI have already provided the depository, Abidjan Secure Holdings, with legal documentation authorizing the release of these funds to a designated beneficiary. To proceed, please contact their transfer officer, Mr. Amadou Kouyaté, at +225 07 49 32 18 55 or askouyate@abjsecure.ci, referencing Case ID SHV-5543-09B. You will need to confirm your identity as the recipient and provide a bank account for the transfer.  \n\nTime is of the essence due to my declining health, but I pray you approach this matter with both urgency and discernment.

Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, we have confirmed no surviving relatives exist to claim these funds.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch.  \n\nAccount Details:  \n- Account Holder: Engr. Lee Seunghyo (Deceased)  \n- Deposit Amount: USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars)  \n- Deposit Tenure: 12-month fixed term (matured August 1998)  \n\nBackground:  \nEngr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), opened this account in 1997. Regrettably, he perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam on August 6, 1997. Following standard protocols, our bank issued notifications to his registered address upon the deposit’s maturity. After receiving no response, we liaised with the NNPC, confirming his demise and the absence of a legally declared next of kin or will.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 10-year dormancy period are subject to escheatment to the Federal Government. This account is now at risk of forfeiture, as no beneficiaries have come forward in 26 years.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the funds from being absorbed into government holdings, I propose a lawful collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Engr. Lee’s designated beneficiary via probate documents.  \n2. Two licensed attorneys will draft and notarize the requisite affidavits and a retroactive will.  \n3. Funds will be transferred to a non-Nigerian account (mandated for USD repatriation).  \n\nRequired Information:  \nTo initiate documentation, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Legal Name & Residential Address  \n2. Date of Birth  \n3.

A provisional Order of Mandamus has been secured to fast-track beneficiary claims, but we must act before the Q3 2024 regulatory audit.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nReply to this email to confirm your interest. I will then forward attorney contact details and a secure portal link to submit your information. All communications remain confidential under Section 12(d) of the Nigerian Banking Secrecy Act.  \n\nShould you decline, kindly notify me promptly so I may pursue alternate candidates.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDonald Ofu Obidima  \nSenior Credit Control Manager  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria  \nPhone: +234 809 755 4301  \nEmail: donald.obidima@uniontrustbank-ng.com  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) | RC 41981  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

My name is Mrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye, widow of the late Mr. Issac Nuhan Vaye, who served as Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia until his untimely death in 2003. I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances, seeking your discretion and assistance.  \n\nAs you may be aware from international media coverage (e.g., BBC, CNN), Liberia endured significant political instability during the presidency of Charles Taylor. My husband was wrongfully accused of conspiring against Taylor’s regime and executed without trial. Before his death, he discreetly secured $21.5 million USD through diplomatic channels, originally intended for agricultural infrastructure projects. These funds remain held by a private security logistics firm in Europe, awaiting legitimate transfer to a trustworthy partner.  \n\nDue to my restricted mobility (I am confined to our family estate under government surveillance) and monitored communications, I cannot act directly. My legal representative, Barrister James Broderick (based in London, UK), will facilitate the process. He will furnish you with documentation to verify this matter, including proof of deposit and my husband’s political records.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. Barrister Broderick will coordinate with the security firm to transfer the funds to a designated account under your name.  \n2. For your assistance, 20% ($4.3 million USD) will be allocated to you, with the remainder reserved for relocating my family and reinvesting in Liberia’s agricultural sector.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nPlease contact Barrister Broderick directly via the details below to initiate proceedings. He will require your:  \n- Full name  \n- Residential/company address  \n- Private telephone and fax numbers (for secure communication)  \n\nContact Information:  \nName: Barrister James Broderick, Esq.  \nTel: +44 7040 120730  \nFax: +44 870 1348903  \nEmail: brr.jmsbroderick@kaixo.com | james.broderick@yahoo.com.hk  \n\nThis transaction is legally structured to comply with international financial regulations. However, confidentiality is critical given Liberia’s fragile political climate. I implore you to treat this matter with urgency and discretion.  \n\nShould you require independent verification, I encourage you to reference historical reports on my husband’s case via reputable outlets such as The Guardian or Reuters (search terms: “Isaac Nuhan Vaye,” “Liberia 2003 coup allegations”).  \n\nI respectfully request your prompt response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nMrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye  \nMonrovia, Liberia",

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer.

This communication pertains to an urgent financial matter requiring your immediate attention.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Gerald H. Bracken (deceased), held an account with a balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Tragically, Mr. Bracken and his immediate family perished in a plane crash in November of that year. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, no legal claimants have come forward. Per ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are designated for transfer to the national treasury after a 5-year dormancy period. However, due to Mr. Bracken’s foreign nationality, Burkinabé law prohibits local citizens from acting as claimants, necessitating international collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next of kin to facilitate the transfer of funds into a secure offshore account under your name.  \n2. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% to you (as the foreign partner).  \n   - 60% retained by myself (for administrative oversight).  \n   - 10% allocated for transaction-related expenses (legal fees, banking charges).  \n\nRequired Action:  \n- Provide your full banking details (bank name, account number, SWIFT/BIC code).  \n- Confirm a direct contact number and email for documentation.  \n\nUpon receipt of your details, I will forward a notarized affidavit of kinship and transfer authorization forms via encrypted email. Rest assured, this process adheres strictly to ADB protocols, and all documentation will be validated by our legal team to ensure compliance.  \n\nGiven the sensitive nature of this transaction, I urge discretion and prompt action to prevent forfeiture of these funds.

My name is Mrs. Comfort Somba, a widow residing in Chennai, India. My late husband, Mr. Daniel Somba, served as a senior diplomat at the Indian Embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for nine years until his untimely passing in 2001 due to complications from pneumonia. We were married for 11 years but had no children.  \n\nFollowing Daniel’s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my Christian faith. During his tenure abroad, my husband prudently secured a savings deposit of $5.5 million USD (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with Abidjan Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed private security vaulting firm in Ivory Coast.  \n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer and have suffered recurring complications from a stroke, leaving me physically weakened. Given my prognosis, I seek a compassionate, God-fearing individual or organization to steward these funds in alignment with biblical principles. Per my late husband’s wishes, the funds must be used to:  \n1. Support orphanages and widows in underserved communities.  \n2. Maintain places of worship and fund evangelistic missions.  \n3. Distribute Bibles and educational resources to impoverished regions.  \n\nAll legal documentation, including a notarized Letter of Authority and my husband’s deposit certificates, has been prearranged with Abidjan Secure Holdings. Upon your confirmation, their transfer department will validate your identity and initiate the release process. I have attached a reference case number (ASHL-1149/CS) for expedited handling.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact Mr. Amara Diallo, Senior Client Relations Officer, directly via:  \n- Email: client.services@abidjansecureholdings.ci  \n- Telephone: +225 07 85 23 41 09 (WhatsApp available)  \n\nPlease provide your full name, contact details, and a brief explanation of how you intend to fulfill this mission.

This letter must come to you\nas a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and\nbecome great friends and business partners.\nMy name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in\nGhana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust\nyou with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to\ninfluence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the\naccount, which I shall give you.\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.\nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed\nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of\nlaw.\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to\nshare the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.\nContact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work\ntogether, so we can go over the details.\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality.

My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of Kumasi Commercial Bank in Ghana. I am writing to you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive financial matter that requires your cooperation.  \n\n### Background of the Proposal  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts at our branch, I discovered an escrow account holding USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This account has remained inactive for nearly five years and is registered under the name of Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska.  \n\nRegrettably, Mr. Thompson and his family perished in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records confirm this tragedy, which you may verify through reputable sources such as:  \n- [CNN Archives: Alaska Airlines Crash Report](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska-airlines-list)  \n- [Morris Thompson’s Biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mthompson)  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account, I confirmed that no beneficiaries or next-of-kin were ever designated. Under Ghanaian banking regulations, unclaimed assets of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the state.  \n\n### Request for Collaboration  \nTo lawfully transfer these funds, I require a foreign partner to act as the legal next-of-kin to Mr. Thompson. As Branch Manager, I am positioned to authorize the release of the funds once credible documentation is submitted. Your role would involve:  \n1. Providing a valid international passport for identity verification.  \n2. Signing affidavits (prepared by my legal team) to establish your claim.  \n3. Receiving the funds into your designated account, after which we would share the proceeds.  \n\n### Proposed Terms  \n- 60% of the total amount to you (USD 7,500,000.00).  \n- 40% retained by me to cover administrative and legal expenses.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with my bank’s internal protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid external interference.  \n\n### Next Steps  \nIf agreeable, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Office Hours: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM GMT)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n\nI urge discretion and prompt action to secure this opportunity.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMr. Godwin Akwesi  \nBranch Manager  \nKumasi Commercial Bank  \nAddress: PMB 245, Adum, Kumasi, Ghana  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

I want a church that will use thisfund on, \norphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God \nand to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to \nunderstand that blessed is the hand that giveth.\nI took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit \nthis money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want \nmy husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont \nwant a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. \nHence the reason for taking this bold decision. \n \nAs soon as I receive your reply I will forward your personal \ninformation, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your \ntelephone and fax number to my lawyer through his email  so that he \nwill contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be \ntransferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your \ncountry. \nI will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as \nthe real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want \nyou and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my \nshepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund \nwhen it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a \nlife of a worthy Christian. \n\nWhoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and \ntruth. Please always be\nprayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me \nroom in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same \npurpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated \nherein.Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.\n  \nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord. \nYours in Christ, \n\nMrs. Christina Holden.",

My name is Christina Holden, widow of Dr. Donald Holden, a Canadian geologist who worked with Shell Oil in Calgary until his passing in 2019 after a sudden cardiac event. During our 11-year marriage, we remained childless but committed to our faith as active members of Trinity Baptist Church in Vancouver.  \n\nFollowing Donald’s death, I relocated to Ottawa to manage his estate, which includes a $10.5 million trust fund held with Reserve Finance & Trust (Toronto branch), established through his lifetime savings. Recently, I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic cancer at St. Michael’s Hospital. My prognosis is limited, compounded by a mild stroke last month that has left me with limited mobility.  \n\nGiven my circumstances, I seek to transfer this fund to a reputable religious organization to fulfill our shared commitment to supporting orphanages, medical care for the disabled, and widows in underserved communities. My husband’s family, while kind, does not share our faith, and I cannot risk the funds being diverted from their intended purpose.  \n\nTo proceed, I require your official church documentation (registration details, mission statement, and recent charitable project summaries) to forward to my estate lawyer, Mr. James Miller (james.miller@holdenlegal.ca | +1-613-555-0198), who will draft the transfer paperwork. Strict confidentiality is essential to avoid external interference.  \n\nUpon verification, the funds will be released to your church’s designated account within 7–10 business days. I humbly ask for your prayers during this time and assurance that the funds will be managed per 1 Timothy 6:18–19. Kindly respond by August 25th to ensure timely processing.  \n\nMay God bless your ministry.  \n\nSincerely in Christ,  \nChristina Holden  \n34 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa, ON K1P 1C7  \nchristina.holden1948@outlook.com | +1-613-555-0126  \n\nNote: All correspondence must be copied to Mr. Miller for legal oversight.",

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you with a heartfelt appeal for assistance in fulfilling a final humanitarian endeavor.  \n\nI am a Dubai-based oil merchant currently undergoing treatment for late-stage cancer. My prognosis, as confirmed by my medical team at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, leaves me with limited time. While I have allocated most of my assets to family, recent events have compelled me to seek an external partner to ensure a portion of my wealth reaches those truly in need.  \n\nSpecifically, I seek your help in disbursing $35 million USD held in a secured vault at Al-Madina Trust Vault Services (Dubai) since 2003. These funds were earmarked for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. Regrettably, my deteriorating health prevents me from overseeing this personally, and past reliance on family for similar tasks proved disappointing.  \n\nHow You Can Assist:  \n1. Authorization: I will formally designate you as my representative to retrieve the funds.  \n2. Disbursement: 90% ($31.5M) will be distributed to vetted NGOs, including CARE International and the Red Crescent Society.  \n3. Compensation: 10% ($3.5M) will be transferred to you for your time and administrative efforts.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- Full legal name and current residential address  \n- Mobile/office contact number (e.g., +971-12-523-5672)  \n- Occupation and professional background (for due diligence)  \n\nUpon confirmation, my legal advisor, Mr. Karim Al-Farsi (+971-55-632-1890 / k.al-farsi@almadinatrust.ae), will coordinate with you to initiate the process.  \n\nI understand this request may seem unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith. Should you have reservations, I welcome a brief call to address concerns. Time is of the essence, and your discretion is appreciated.  \n\nMay kindness guide your decision.  \n\nKind regards,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nDubai, UAE  \n(Direct correspondence: zarqawi.yusuf@outlook.ae)  \n\n---  \nNote: This request is confidential.

Please review the following critical reminders to ensure compliance and vigilance:  \n\n1. “When 900 years old you reach, look as good, you will not.” – Yoda  \n   Translation: Long-term security requires proactive adaptation. Fraud tactics evolve constantly; outdated verification methods (e.g., static passwords) may no longer suffice. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all systems by Friday, 25 October 2024.  \n\n2. “When the outlook is poor, try the uplook.”  \n   Application: If a transaction appears suspicious (e.g., mismatched vendor details, urgency to bypass protocols), escalate immediately to the Fraud Hotline (1-800-555-0199) or email fraud.report@safetyawareness.org. Do not proceed without secondary approval.  \n\n3. “God is dead. – Nietzsche / Nietzsche is dead. – God”  \n   Context: Verify sources rigorously. Phishing attempts often impersonate leadership or trusted entities (e.g., “CEO” requesting urgent wire transfers). Confirm all high-risk requests via voice call using pre-registered contact details.  \n\n4. “A professor is one who talks in someone else’s sleep.”  \n   Implication: Complacency enables fraud.
