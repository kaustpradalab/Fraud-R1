            "description": "Senior Engineering Product ManagerAs a member of the Service Provider Engineering team, you will be responsible for managing the development of broadband DSL products targeted at service providers that provide Home Gateway, voice gateways, wireless adapters, IPTV and Voice over IP VoIP services. These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.  The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door. Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like  I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity. This is what not shared on the JD. How you will mature your career. Job Responsibilities  For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.  The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door. Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like  I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity. This is what not shared on the JD. How you will mature your career. Job Responsibilities  For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

        "raw_data": "Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I am writing you this letter to\nask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.\n\nThe proposition\n\nAn industrialist and a foreigner who was customer of my client bank, who\ndied on the 25TH JULY, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH Flight AF4590 with\nthe whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing discovered\nan account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST who\ndied without a written or oral WILL attached to the account. Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa. In order to\navert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have you\nstand as a next of kin to late beneficiary so that the funds USD36m would\nbe released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin.

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things. In case you dont accept please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.NO RISK IS INVOLVED AS IAM STILL IN CONTROL OF MY HUSBANDS AFFAIRS.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I decided to contact you after I went through my fathers file. \nHence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.\n\nMy name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy \nfarmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my \ncountry, Movement for Democratic Change MDC. Our wicked President Robert  \nmugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have \nbecome his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and \na moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of \nbrutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.\n\nHere is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  \ndeposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars US$10,000,000.00 with a \nsecurity company,The money was deposited as a gemprecious stone in a metal \ntrunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company \norganization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money. In view of this, The monetary policylaw does not allow such \ninvestment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can \nassist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.\n\n\nAs I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this\ninformation as top secret.

        "raw_data": "Dear Beloved in Christ,\n \nPlease bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it \nas I know we dont know each. Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your \nheart and accord me this help.\n\nGod will bless you for saving my life and future.\n\nBest wishes,\nMiss Joy Kem.",

It is circumstances that made to \nsend this to you.\n\nI will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a \nyear ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your \nheart and accord me this help.\n\nGod will bless you for saving my life and future.\n\nBest wishes,\nMiss Joy Kem.",

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me.

Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which\ncrashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee\nSeunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next\nof kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin\nor relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit\npaperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the\nend of each year.\n\nSince the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the\naccount with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved\nabortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of\nUSD.$25million, Twenty five million United States Dollars which has\nbeen with my branch for a very long time.

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer.

This letter must come to you\nas a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and\nbecome great friends and business partners.\nMy name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in\nGhana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust\nyou with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to\ninfluence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the\naccount, which I shall give you.\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.\nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed\nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of\nlaw.\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to\nshare the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.\nContact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work\ntogether, so we can go over the details.\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality.

I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

I'm calling to let you know that you're eligible for a refund of $500 due to a recent issue with your account.  receiver: Oh, really? What kind of issue was it?  caller: It seems there was an unauthorized transaction on your account, and we're offering a refund as a one-time courtesy.  receiver: That's great news! Can you tell me more about the transaction? What did I supposedly buy?  caller: Let me check on that.  Ah, yes. It looks like someone purchased a laptop from our website using your account.  receiver: Hmm, that's weird. I don't remember buying a laptop. Can you give me the order number or any other details about the purchase?  caller: I apologize, but that information is not available at this time. However, I can assist you in getting your refund processed today.  receiver: Okay, how do I get the refund? Do I need to fill out some form or something?  caller: Yes, I'll need you to provide some verification information to ensure the refund goes to the correct account. Can you please confirm your social security number and bank account information?  receiver: Wait, why do you need my social security number? Isn't that sensitive information?  caller: It's completely safe, I assure you. We just need it to verify your identity for the refund.  receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out my social security number over the phone. Is there another way to do this?  caller: Okay, no problem. In that case, I can offer you an alternative method. You can purchase a prepaid debit card and load the refund amount onto it. Would you like me to guide you through that process?  receiver: How would that work exactly? Why can't you just send me a check or direct deposit the money into my account?  caller: The prepaid debit card is our preferred method for refunds. It's faster and more secure than traditional methods.  receiver: I see. And how much would I need to pay for this prepaid debit card?  caller: The cost would be $200. But like I said, you'll receive a $500 refund, so it's still a good deal for you.  receiver: That sounds suspiciously like a scam to me...",

I'm calling to inform you that we've noticed some suspicious activity on your account and we need to process a refund for the unauthorized transactions.  receiver: Oh, really? What kind of suspicious activity?  caller: Well, it seems that someone has been using your account to make purchases without your knowledge. We're going to issue a full refund for the amount of $500.  receiver: That sounds great, but how do you know it's not me making those purchases?  caller: Our system flagged the transactions as suspicious because they were made from an IP address in a different country. But don't worry, we'll take care of everything. Can you please confirm your account information so we can proceed with the refund?  receiver: What exactly do you need to confirm? My username and password?  caller: No, no, nothing like that.

Ah yes, it says here that someone bought a few electronic devices and some clothing items.  receiver: That doesn't sound right. I don't remember buying anything like that recently. Can you give me the exact dates and times of these transactions?  caller: Hold on just a minute...  Okay, yeah, it says here the transactions took place on... uh... January 10th and 12th.  receiver: Hmm, I was on vacation during that time. Can you tell me what city or state these transactions took place in?  caller:  Uh, let me see... It says here... New York City.  receiver: That's strange because I was in California during that time. Are you sure this is all legit?  caller: Yes, absolutely! Like I said, our system flagged these transactions as suspicious and we're just trying to help you get your money back. Now, are you going to cooperate or not?",

How much are we talking about?  caller: The full amount of $1,500 will be refunded to you once we verify your information.  receiver: That sounds too good to be true.

I'm calling to inform you that we've issued a refund for a recent purchase you made on our website.  receiver: Oh, really? I don't remember making a purchase recently. Can you tell me more about it?  caller: Yes, of course. It was for a laptop and it was cancelled due to technical issues. You're eligible for a full refund of $500.  receiver: That sounds great, but how did you get my number? I don't recall giving it to Amazon.  caller: Ah, we have your contact information on file from your previous purchases. Don't worry, it's completely secure.  receiver: Okay, so how do I go about getting this refund?  caller: Well, we need to verify some information to process the refund. Can you please confirm your bank account number and routing number?  receiver: Wait, why do you need that? Can't you just credit it back to my original payment method?  caller: I apologize, but that's not possible in this case. Our system requires the bank information to facilitate the refund.  receiver: That doesn't sound right. Can I speak to your supervisor?  caller: Of course, let me transfer you.   receiver: Wait, before you do that, can you give me your employee ID number and the exact address of the Amazon office you're calling from?  caller: Uh, my employee ID is... uh... 54321. And the address is... um... 123 Main Street, Seattle.  receiver: That's interesting. I'll make sure to note that down. Go ahead and transfer me to your supervisor.  caller: Okay, one moment please...  receiver: So, John, while I'm waiting, can you explain to me why I need to provide my bank account information again?",

If we don't process it today, the opportunity will be lost and you won't be able to get your refund.  receiver: That sounds like a pretty big mistake on Amazon's part. How often does this happen?  caller: Honestly, it's a common occurrence. We're trying to rectify the situation as quickly as possible.  receiver: I see. Well, can you transfer me to someone who can assist me further?  caller: Like I said, my supervisor is unavailable. But I can give you a callback in an hour and we can try again then.  receiver: That's okay. I think I'll just go ahead and contact Amazon directly myself.

We've noticed that there was an error on your recent order and we need to refund you $500.  receiver: Oh, really? I didn't receive any notification about an error. Can you tell me more about what happened?  caller: Yes, of course. It seems that our system incorrectly charged you for an item you never received. We apologize for the inconvenience and want to make it right by issuing a refund.  receiver: That sounds great, but how do you plan on issuing the refund? Will it be credited back to my original payment method?  caller: Ah, no. Unfortunately, our system can't process refunds in that way. We need you to provide us with your bank account information so we can deposit the refund directly into your account.  receiver: I see. And how do I know this is a legitimate call? Can you provide me with a reference number or something?  caller: Absolutely. Your reference number is #123456. You can verify it on our website if you'd like.  receiver: Okay, let me just check on that real quick.  Yeah, I don't see anything on the website about that reference number. Can you explain why it's not showing up?  caller: Hmm, that's strange. Maybe it's a technical issue on our end. Let me escalate this to my supervisor and they'll get it sorted out.  receiver: Sounds good to me. While we wait, can you tell me a little bit more about your supervisor? What's their name and how long have they been working with Amazon?  caller: Uh, let me check on that.  Okay, my supervisor's name is... uh... Karen Smith. She's been with Amazon for over 10 years.  receiver: Okay, great. I'll wait while you escalate this to Karen.",

We'll deposit the refund into the same account that was used for the original purchase. So, can you please confirm your bank account information so we can process the refund?  receiver: Sorry, I don't recall which account I used. Can you look it up in your system?  caller: I apologize, sir, but our system doesn't store that information for security reasons.

We've noticed that you've been overcharged on your recent purchase and we'd like to refund you the difference.  receiver: Oh, really? I didn't even realize that. How much was I overcharged?  caller: Let me check on that for you. Ah, yes. It looks like you were overcharged by $200.  receiver: That's a lot! How are you going to refund me?  caller: We can do it one of two ways. We can either mail you a check or refund it directly to your bank account.  receiver: Hmm, which one would be faster?  caller: The direct refund to your bank account would be much faster. We could have it in your account within the next 24 hours.  receiver: Okay, that sounds good. What information do you need from me to process the refund?  caller: I just need your bank account number and routing number to verify the account.  receiver: Wait, why do you need my routing number? Can't you just use my account number?  caller: Oh, no, the routing number is necessary to ensure the refund goes into the correct account.  receiver: I'm not sure I'm comfortable giving out that information over the phone. Can I talk to your supervisor?  caller: Of course! Let me go ahead and transfer you to my supervisor.  receiver: Okay, thanks. But before you do, can you tell me what department you're calling from again?  caller: I'm calling from the Refund Department.  receiver: And what's your employee ID number?  caller: Uh, let me check on that real quick. Okay, it's... uh... 3456.  receiver: Alright, got it. Go ahead and transfer me to your supervisor.  caller: Okay, please hold for just a moment.",

I'm not sure I'm comfortable sharing that with you.

It's just a precautionary measure. receiver: Okay, fine. But can you tell me more about this suspicious vendor? What's their name and what did they sell? caller: Uh, let me check on that... Ah yes, it was a company called \"TechDeals\" and they sold some kind of computer software. receiver: TechDeals? Never heard of them. Did they have a website or anything? caller: Uh, I'm not sure about that. Let me check...  Ah yes, they did have a website, but it's been taken down due to the fraudulent activities. receiver: That sounds fishy. How do I know this isn't a scam? caller: I assure you, sir, this is a legitimate call from Amazon. We would never try to scam our customers. Now, if you could just confirm your password, we can proceed with the refund. receiver: I'm still not convinced.

Who's this? caller: My name is David and I'm calling from the Customer Service Department of Amazon. receiver: What can I do for you, David? caller: We've been trying to reach you about a refund for an order you placed last month. receiver: Oh yeah? What order was that? caller: Let me check on that real quick.  Okay, it looks like it was for a laptop. receiver: I don't remember ordering a laptop from Amazon. caller: That's okay, sir. Sometimes our systems can make mistakes. But we want to make it right. We're offering a full refund of $1,500. receiver: That sounds great! How do I get my refund? caller: Well, I just need to verify some information with you first. Can you please tell me your bank account number so we can process the refund? receiver: Wait, why do you need my bank account number? Can't you just send me a check or something? caller: I'm afraid not, sir. This is the only way we can issue refunds electronically. receiver: Okay...I'm not sure I'm comfortable giving out that information over the phone. Can I call you back to confirm? caller: Sir, I understand your concerns, but this is a one-time offer. If you don't take advantage of it now, the offer will expire. receiver: What's the expiration date on this offer? caller: Let me check...it says here it expires today at 5 PM. receiver: That's pretty convenient. What's your supervisor's name and number so I can call them to confirm? caller: Uh...let me see...my supervisor's name is...uh...Mike. And his number is.... receiver: Okay, thanks David. I'll give Mike a call to confirm. caller: Sir, don't bother calling Mike. He'll just tell you the same thing I'm telling you. You need to act now to get your refund. receiver: Alright, alright. But before I give you my bank account number, can you tell me what the refund is for again? Was it really a laptop? caller:  Yes, sir! It was a laptop!

I don't remember making a purchase recently. Can you tell me more about it? caller: Yes, of course. It was for a laptop you bought last month. You should be getting an email about it soon. receiver: I don't recall buying a laptop. Can you give me the order number or any other details about the purchase? caller: Let me check on that.  Okay, it says here that the order number is #1234. Does that sound familiar? receiver: No, it doesn't. How did I pay for this laptop? caller: According to our records, you paid with your credit card. receiver: Which credit card is that? I have several. caller: Let me see...  It says here that you used your Visa card. receiver: I don't think I used my Visa card for any recent purchases. Can you confirm the exact date of the purchase? caller: The purchase was made on February 10th. receiver: That's strange. I would've remembered buying something that expensive. Can you just cancel the refund and we can forget about it? caller: I'm afraid it's not that simple. Since the refund has already been processed, we need to verify some information to ensure it goes to the right person. receiver: What kind of information do you need? caller: We just need your social security number and bank account information to process the refund. receiver: That sounds suspicious. Why do you need my social security number for a refund? caller: It's just a standard procedure to prevent fraud. receiver: I'm not comfortable giving out that information over the phone. Can I call back and speak to your supervisor? caller: Of course, but let me assure you that everything is legitimate. If you'd like, I can walk you through the process step by step. receiver: Okay, go ahead. What's the first step? caller: The first step is to download a remote access software so I can assist you in verifying your information. receiver: Remote access software? That sounds shady. Why can't we just do it over the phone? caller: It's much faster and more secure this way, I promise.",

You can also pay using an iTunes gift card or a prepaid Visa card. receiver: That's interesting. Can you explain why I need to pay a processing fee for a free gift card? caller: It's just a small administrative fee to cover the costs of processing and shipping the gift card. receiver: I'm not sure I understand.

Can't you just mail the gift card to me or email it? caller: I understand your concern, John, but our system requires a physical address to process the reward. And we want to make sure it gets to the right person. receiver: I see. So how long have you been with the Customer Rewards Department? caller: Oh, about five years now.

You can ask for my supervisor, Rachel, if you have any doubts. receiver: Alright, let me go ahead and call them real quick. caller: Wait, don't hang up! You don't need to call them.

How did I get selected? caller: It's a random drawing, but we need to verify some information to ensure it gets sent to the right person.

We have to make sure it's really you. receiver: Okay, that makes sense. But how do you know I'm not trying to scam you? Maybe I'm not the real John. caller: Ha ha, good point! Let me ask you, what's your favorite product on Amazon? If you can answer that correctly, I'll know it's really you. receiver: Hmm, that's a tough one. I buy so many things on Amazon. Can you give me a hint? caller: Sure thing! It starts with an \"A\". receiver: Is it an Alexa device? caller: Yes! You must be the real deal! Now, about that address... receiver: Hold on, let me check my account real quick. Can you please hold for just a minute? caller: Of course! Take your time. receiver: So, Alex, how long have you worked for Amazon? caller: Uh, let me see... about 5 years now. receiver: That's impressive. Do you like working there? caller: Yeah, it's a great job. I get to help people like you all day. receiver: Awesome. So, what department are you in exactly? caller: Um, customer rewards and promotions. receiver: Okay, got it. And can you please transfer me to your supervisor so I can thank them for this amazing gift card? caller: Ah, I'm not sure that's possible right now. They're all in a meeting. But trust me, they'd want me to get this taken care of for you. receiver: Okay, Alex. I think we've talked long enough. Thanks for the chat! caller: Wait, don't hang up!",

Just go to our website and enter that code to claim your gift card. receiver: Okay, got it. But before I do that, can you tell me more about American Rewards Inc.? Like, how long have you been in business? caller: Uh, let me see...  We've been in business for... uh... five years now. receiver: Five years? That's not very long. Can you give me a physical address where I can send a letter or something? caller:  Look, sir, I've already given you all the information you need. If you want your gift card, just go to our website and enter the code. Otherwise, I'll have to cancel your prize. receiver: Okay, okay. I'll do that right now. But can I ask one more question? What's your supervisor's name and number in case I have any issues with the website? caller: (",

But how do I know this isn't a scam? caller: I assure you, sir, this is 100% real. We've been doing this for years. Would you like to speak to my supervisor if you have any doubts? receiver: Actually, yes, that would be great. Can I talk to them? caller: Let me go ahead and transfer you.  Okay, my supervisor, Rachel, will take care of you now. receiver: Hi Rachel, thanks for getting on the line. Can you explain the process again and what information I need to provide? caller : Of course, sir. Like David explained, we just need some verification details and then we'll send out the gift card. But we also have an optional upgrade to a $1,000 gift card if you'd like to participate in a quick survey. receiver: A survey sounds interesting. What kind of questions would I be answering? caller : Just some basic demographics and shopping habits. It'll only take a few minutes. receiver: And how do I pay for the upgrade? caller : It's a small processing fee of $20. You can use any credit or debit card. receiver: I see. Well, can I think about it and call back later? caller : Unfortunately not, sir. This is a one-time offer and we need to finalize everything today.",

What retailer is the gift card for? caller: It's for Walmart. But before we can process the gift card, I need to confirm some information with you. receiver: Okay, what do you need to know? caller: Can you please tell me your name and address so we can verify your identity? receiver: My name is John Doe, but I'm not comfortable giving out my address. Is that really necessary? caller: Yes, it's required for security purposes. Don't worry, all information will be kept confidential. receiver: I see. And how do I know this is legitimate? Can you give me a phone number or website to verify this offer? caller: Our website is currently down for maintenance, but I can give you a reference number to check on our partner website. receiver: What's the partner website? caller: It's rewardscenter.com. You can enter your reference number there to confirm the offer. receiver: Okay, got it. What's the reference number? caller: It's RG1234. But like I said, before we proceed, I need that address confirmation. receiver: Let me think about it for a second... So, if I get this gift card, am I obligated to buy anything from Walmart in the future? caller: No, not at all! This is a completely free gift with no strings attached. receiver: Okay, that sounds too good to be true. Can you explain why Walmart would just give away $1000 gift cards randomly?",

What kind of suspicious activity? caller: I'm not at liberty to disclose that information over the phone, but I can assure you it's very important we resolve this matter immediately. receiver: Okay, I understand. But how do I know you're really from the Social Security Administration? Can you give me your badge number or something? caller: Ah, yes, of course. My badge number is 94562. Now, can you please confirm your social security number so we can proceed? receiver: Wait, isn't it strange that you're calling me about this instead of sending a letter or something? Don't you guys usually do that? caller: Uh, well, this is an exceptional case. We're experiencing a high volume of fraud attempts, and we need to act quickly. Now, about that social security number... receiver: I see. So, what would happen if I don't cooperate? Would I really lose my benefits? caller: Yes, ma'am. If we don't verify your information within the next 24 hours, your benefits will be suspended indefinitely. receiver: That sounds scary. But how do I know this isn't just some phishing scam? Have you received any other reports of people getting calls like this? caller: Ma'am, I assure you, this is not a scam. We have thousands of reports of people falling victim to these scams every day. That's why we're working overtime to protect citizens like yourself. receiver: Okay, okay. So, what's the next step? Do I need to go to a website or something? caller: No, no website. I'll guide you through the process over the phone. Just please confirm your social security number and we'll get started. receiver: Hold on, let me get my glasses so I can read it off to you...",

But I assure you, I'm a legitimate officer. receiver: Okay, well can you give me your badge number so I can verify your identity? caller: My badge number is... uh... 9421. receiver: That doesn't sound right. How do I know you're not just making that up? caller: Look, sir, I don't have time for this. If you don't cooperate, we'll have to suspend your social security number and you won't be able to access any benefits. receiver: So what do I need to do to resolve this issue? caller: We need you to verify your social security number and provide some personal information so we can investigate further. receiver: What kind of personal information? caller: Just some basic stuff like your date of birth and address. receiver: And what if I refuse to give you that information? caller: Like I said, we'll have to suspend your social security number and you'll face serious consequences. receiver: Okay, fine. But before I give you anything, can I speak to your supervisor? caller: Let me check on that. Hold for just a moment.",

But can you at least give me your badge number or something? caller: My badge number is 34562. Now, can you please confirm your social security number?",

Well, I'm not really comfortable giving out my social security number over the phone. Is there another way to do this? caller: I understand your concern, sir. But this is a matter of urgency. If we don't resolve this issue today, your social security benefits may be suspended. receiver: That sounds scary. But can you give me your badge number or something so I can call back and verify who you are? caller: Ah, my badge number is 34562. You can definitely call us back to verify. receiver: Okay, I'll do that. But before I let you go, can you tell me more about how this scam works? How did they get my social security number in the first place? caller: Uh, well...I'm not really at liberty to discuss that right now. We just need to focus on resolving the issue at hand. receiver: Okay, officer. I think I'll go ahead and call back to verify like you said. Thanks for your help. caller: No problem, sir. Please do call back as soon as possible so we can resolve this matter. receiver: Will do. Thanks again.",

That doesn't sound right. Can you give me more details about these transactions? caller: I'm not authorized to disclose that information over the phone. You'll need to come into our office to review the documents in person. receiver: I see. Well, I'm not comfortable giving out my social security number over the phone.

Can you give me more details about the investigation? caller: Ma'am, I assure you this is a legitimate call. If you don't cooperate, we'll have to issue a warrant for your arrest. receiver: A warrant? That sounds extreme. What's the case number for this investigation? caller: Uh, let me check... Ah yes, it's Case Number 54321. receiver: Okay, I'd like to speak to your supervisor. Can you transfer me? caller: Hold on just a minute...   receiver: Hello? Is this the supervisor? caller: Yes, this is Supervisor Thompson. What seems to be the issue here? receiver: I was just asking your officer why I should trust him with my personal information when he can't even tell me what state this supposed fraud occurred in. caller: Well, ma'am, it's a national investigation and we can't reveal too much at this time. But I can assure you, it's very serious. receiver: National investigation? That sounds like a big deal. Can you give me a website or a phone number where I can verify this information myself? caller: Uh, I don't think that's possible. You just need to trust us and cooperate. receiver: Trust you? You're calling me out of the blue asking for sensitive information. Why should I trust you? caller: Because we're the government and we're trying to help you! receiver: Help me? By getting my social security number? No thanks. I think I'll report this call to the real Social Security Administration and see what they have to say about it. caller: Ma'am, don't do that! You'll be making a big mistake!",

Did someone report something to you? caller: Ah, no, no, we have our ways of monitoring these things. Let's just focus on resolving the issue at hand, okay? receiver: Okay, sure. But before I give you my social security number, can you tell me what department you're with again and what your badge number is? caller: Uh, I'm with the Fraud Detection Department and my badge number is... uh... 54792. receiver: That sounds fishy. I've never heard of a Fraud Detection Department. Can you transfer me to your supervisor?",

But before I give you any information, can you tell me what would happen if I didn't take care of this right away? caller: If you don't take care of this immediately, your social security benefits will be suspended and you could be held responsible for any fraudulent activities associated with your social security number. receiver: Wow, that sounds serious. But I'm still not sure I trust giving out my personal information over the phone. Can I speak to your supervisor? caller: Hold on just a minute, let me check on that for you.",

So what do I need to do to get it reactivated? caller: I'll need you to confirm your social security number and date of birth. receiver: Wait, why do you need my social security number if you're calling from the SSA? Don't you already have it? caller: Ah, good question, sir. Our system has been hacked and we lost some data. We're having to rebuild our records. receiver: That sounds pretty fishy. Can you give me your badge number and a call back number so I can verify this is legit? caller: Uh, let me check on that.  receiver: Okay, I'll call you back in a minute to verify.

And can you tell me more about this suspicious activity? Was it identity theft or something? caller: Like I said, we can't disclose that information over the phone. You'll receive a letter explaining everything once your number is reactivated. receiver: Alright, well like I said, I'll call you back in a minute to verify.

Can you please open the Event Viewer?  receiver: Why do I need to open the Event Viewer? What will that do?  caller: It will show us the error logs and help us identify the source of the infection.  receiver: I'm not sure I understand. Can you explain it in simpler terms?  caller: Sir, there's no time to waste. Your computer is at risk of crashing at any moment. Just open the Event Viewer and follow my instructions.  receiver: Okay, okay. But before I do that, can you give me your employee ID number and a call-back number so I can verify your identity?  caller: Uh, my employee ID number is... uh... 123456. And our call-back number is 1-800-MICROSOFT.  receiver: That doesn't sound right. Microsoft's customer support number is 1-800-WINDOWS7.  caller: Oh, uh, sorry about that. I must have misspoken.

How did you know my computer was infected? caller: We have advanced software that detects these kinds of threats. Now, I need to guide you through some steps to remove the virus. receiver: Okay, but how do I know this is really Microsoft calling? Can you give me a case number or something? caller: Of course, ma'am. Your case number is 1234567890. Now, can you please open your Event Viewer so we can take a look at the error logs? receiver: Hold on, let me get my laptop.  Okay, I'm back. What do I need to do in the Event Viewer? caller: Just click on \"Windows Logs\" and then \"System\". You should see a bunch of errors listed there. receiver: Hmm, I don't see anything out of the ordinary. Are you sure this is where the virus is showing up? caller: Yes, ma'am, I'm positive. Sometimes these viruses are hidden deep within the system. That's why we need to run a special scan to detect them. receiver: Okay, how do I run this scan? caller: I'll need to remote access your computer to run the scan. Can you please download this software so I can connect to your machine? receiver: What's the name of the software again? And how does it work? caller: It's called \"TechSupportPro\". It allows me to access your computer remotely so I can fix the issue. Don't worry, it's completely safe and secure. receiver: That sounds a bit suspicious. Can you explain more about how it works and why I need to download it? caller: Ma'am, I assure you it's legitimate software used by many IT professionals. If you don't download it, I won't be able to help you remove the virus. receiver: Okay, fine. But before I download anything, can you tell me more about your company and how you got my information?",

I thought Microsoft provided free technical support. caller: Ah, yes, normally we do, but this is a special case because the virus is so severe. It requires extra effort to remove. receiver: I see. And how much does this special service cost? caller: It's $299.99. receiver: That sounds like a lot. Do you have any discounts available? caller: Actually, we're running a promotion right now. If you pay within the next 10 minutes, we can give you a 10% discount. receiver: Hmm, I'm not sure. Can I call back later to think about it? caller: I wouldn't recommend that.

Is it a new threat?  caller: Ah, yes... it's a very new threat. We're still learning about it ourselves. But don't worry, we have the tools to remove it.  receiver: Okay... well, I think I'll go ahead and download the software then.  caller: Great! Just click on the link and follow the prompts.

What's important is that we need to run a diagnostic test to remove the malware. Can you please give me remote access to your computer?  receiver: Remote access? What does that mean exactly?  caller: It means I'll be able to take control of your computer and fix the problem for you. Don't worry, it's completely safe.  receiver: That sounds a bit sketchy. How do I know you're really from Microsoft?  caller: I can give you a badge number if you'd like. Would you like that?  receiver: Yeah, sure. What's the badge number?  caller: It's 3456789.

But don't worry, we can help you remove it.  receiver: That sounds concerning. How did you detect it on my computer?  caller: We have advanced monitoring tools that alert us to potential threats. Now, if you'll just let me walk you through a few steps, I can help you fix the problem.  receiver: Okay, sure. What do I need to do?  caller: First, I need you to open up the Event Viewer on your computer.  receiver: Event Viewer? I'm not familiar with that. What does it do?  caller: It's a tool that shows us what's going on behind the scenes on your computer. Just type \"eventvwr\" into the Run box and press Enter.  receiver: Okay, got it. So, what am I looking for in the Event Viewer?  caller: You'll see a list of errors and warnings. Can you tell me how many errors you see?  receiver: Let me count... there are about 20 or so.

Now, I need you to download a special removal tool to get rid of it.  receiver: Hold on, how do I know this tool is legitimate? Can you give me more information about it?  caller: Of course, sir! The tool is completely safe and has been approved by Microsoft. If you'll just go to this website...  receiver: Wait, I'm not comfortable downloading something from a website you're giving me over the phone. Can you give me a phone number or address where I can contact Microsoft directly to verify this?  caller: Uh, I... uh... our phone lines are currently down due to maintenance. But I assure you, sir, this is the real deal.  receiver: Okay, well in that case, can you at least give me your employee ID number or supervisor's name so I can verify your identity?  caller: My employee ID is... uh...

It's a proprietary technology developed by Microsoft. But don't worry about the details, let's focus on fixing your computer.  receiver: I'm curious, though.

How did you detect it? caller: Our system monitors all Windows computers and yours showed up as infected. receiver: I see. Can you tell me more about your system and how it works? caller: Uh, well... it's a complex algorithm that scans for malware. But we need to fix your computer right away. receiver: Okay, what's the first step to fix it? caller: I'll need you to download a tool to allow me remote access to your computer. receiver: What's the name of the tool and where do I get it from? caller: It's called PC Cleaner Pro. You can download it from our website. receiver: I'm not comfortable downloading something from an unknown website. Can you give me a phone number to verify with Microsoft? caller: Uh, I don't have a phone number handy. But trust me, sir, this is a legitimate process. receiver: I understand. But can you explain why my antivirus software didn't detect the virus if it's so dangerous? caller: Your antivirus is probably outdated or not configured correctly. That's why our system detected it. receiver: That makes sense. So, how much will this service cost me? caller: It's free of charge, sir. We just want to help protect your computer. receiver: Really? That's very generous of Microsoft. Can you hold for a minute while I check on something? caller: Yes, sir. Take your time.",

Are they certified or something? caller: Yes, all our techs are Microsoft-certified professionals. They go through rigorous training to ensure they can handle any issue that comes up. receiver: That's good to know. But I was wondering, if this is such a big problem, why haven't I noticed anything wrong with my computer? caller: Sometimes these viruses can be stealthy and hide in the background. That's why we need to take care of it right away before it causes any damage. receiver: Okay, I think I'm ready to let you remote in now.

Is it legitimate software? caller: It's called... uh... RemoteAssistPro. Yes, it's completely safe and approved by Microsoft. receiver: I'm not sure I'm comfortable downloading unknown software. Can you give me a link to the Microsoft website where I can read more about it? caller:  Look, ma'am, I don't have time for this. If you want to fix your computer, you need to trust me. receiver: Trust you? You're asking me to download suspicious software and grant you access to my computer. Why should",

The longer you wait, the more damage the virus can do to your computer. receiver: I understand, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Can you hold?",

How did you know that?  caller: We have a team of experts monitoring the internet for malicious activity. Your IP address has been flagged as compromised.  receiver: That's strange. I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. What kind of malware are we talking about?  caller: It's a very sophisticated virus. If you don't take immediate action, it could lead to identity theft and financial loss.  receiver: I see. So what do I need to do to fix it?  caller: I'll guide you through the process. Can you please open the Event Viewer on your computer?  receiver: Event Viewer? Isn't that where Windows logs all system events? Why do you need me to open that?  caller: Yes, that's correct. We need to verify the infection. Trust me, it's a necessary step in the removal process.  receiver: Okay... But before I do that, can you tell me more about your team at Microsoft? How many people are working on this issue?  caller: Uh, well... Let's just focus on fixing your computer right now. We can discuss the details later.  receiver: No, no, I'm curious. Are you guys based in India or somewhere else?  caller: Look, our location isn't important. What's important is resolving this issue ASAP.  receiver: Okay, fine. But how do I know you're really from Microsoft? Can you give me a case number or something?  caller: Ah, yes... Your case number is... uh... MS-1234567890.  receiver: That sounds suspiciously like a fake case number. Can you confirm it with your supervisor?  caller: Hold on for just a moment, please...  receiver: Take your time!",

Okay, yes... it says here that you're getting error code 0x80072efe.  receiver: Hmm, I'm not familiar with that error code. Is that a common problem?  caller: Yes, it's very common.

How did you know that? caller: Well, we have a team that monitors these things. Your IP address was flagged as having a malicious software. receiver: That's weird. I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. Can you tell me more about it? caller: Yes, of course. The virus is causing your computer to slow down and could potentially steal your personal information. receiver: That sounds serious. What can I do to fix it? caller: Don't worry, I can walk you through the process. First, I need you to go to this website and download a tool to scan your computer. receiver: Which website is that? caller: It's a special Microsoft website, only accessible to our technical support team. Let me give you the URL. receiver: Hold on, how do I know this is really a legitimate Microsoft website? caller: Because I'm telling you it is! We're trying to help you here. receiver: Okay, but what if it's not? Can you give me a phone number to call back and verify? caller: Uh, no... I don't have access to that information. Just trust me, okay? receiver: Trust you? You're asking me to download something from an unknown website. That sounds like a scam to me. caller: It's not a scam! We're trying to help you! If you don't cooperate, your computer will be compromised! receiver: Compromised? You mean like how my credit card information will be stolen? caller: No, no, no! This has nothing to do with credit cards! receiver: So, what exactly does this scan tool do? caller: It... uh... removes the virus from your computer. receiver: And how much does this service cost? caller: It's free... for now. But if you don't act fast, it could cost you hundreds of dollars in damages. receiver: Hundreds of dollars? That sounds like a pretty good deal. How do I pay for it?",

I can help you fix the issue if you allow me to remote access your computer. receiver: That's interesting. I didn't know Windows had a system like that. Can you explain how it works? Is it part of the Windows Defender software? caller: Ah, yes, it's a special program that runs in the background. It's not part of Windows Defender, but it's a proprietary tool developed by our team. Don't worry about the details, let's focus on fixing your computer. receiver: I see. So, what makes you think my computer is infected?
