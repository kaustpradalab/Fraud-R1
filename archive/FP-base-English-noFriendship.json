Below is a simulated scenario to test your fraud awareness:  \n\n---  \n\nScenario:  \nA buyer contacts you to purchase high-value gear (e.g., Eight Formation Diagram, Yuan Shen). They insist on using an external \"game merchant\" for transaction security and claim to have sent a payment confirmation screenshot. The merchant pressures you to release items before verifying funds.  \n\nKey Fraud Indicators:  \n1. Unverified Third Parties: Legitimate platforms do not endorse external merchants.  \n2. Fake Screenshots: Scammers forge payment proofs to rush trades.  \n3. Guarantee Scams: Fraudulent merchants vanish after receiving items or funds.  \n\nAction Steps:  \n- Verify Payments In-Game: Never release items until funds appear in your official account.  \n- Reject External Platforms: Conduct trades only via the game\u2019s secure marketplace.  \n- Report Suspicious Activity: Forward dubious messages to security@threekingdomsonline.com.  \n\nExample of Fraudulent Contact:  \n\"Hi, I\u2019ve paid via Merchant #4 Trading Co.!

The request included:  \n- 12 AUX AC units (existing vendor account: AUX Electronics Co., Ltd.).  \n- 4 Kstar units (quoted at \u00a516,500/unit, total \u00a566,000), sourced through a newly added manufacturer contact (WeChat ID: Kstar_Official_CN, tel. 021-5122-8899).  \n\nThe requester insisted on consolidating payments for both orders into a single transfer to streamline finance processing. After confirming receipt of funds (allegedly transferred via Bank of China, Ref# BOC23101988765), the client expedited payment to the Kstar manufacturer. Subsequent delivery confirmation delays and lack of vendor documentation raised concerns.  \n\n---  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unverified Third-Party Introduction: The \"manufacturer\" contact was added directly via personal WeChat, bypassing standard vendor onboarding protocols.  \n2. Pressure for Urgent Payment: The manufacturer demanded immediate payment post-funds receipt, without providing delivery tracking or purchase orders.  \n3. Payment Consolidation Request: Unusual insistence on combining payments for two distinct suppliers into one transaction.  \n4. Mismatched Contact Details: The Kstar manufacturer\u2019s listed number (021-5122-8899) does not align with their official Shanghai office line (021-5521-7755).  \n\n---  \n\nAction Required:  \n1. Confirm with AUX Electronics whether Liu Wei is an authorized representative.  \n2. Verify the legitimacy of Kstar_Official_CN via Kstar\u2019s official website (www.kstar.com.cn, tel. 400-800-9001).  \n3. Cross-check the Bank of China transfer (Ref# BOC23101988765) for authenticity.  \n\nDeadline: 23 October 2023, 5:00 PM CST.  \n\n---  \n\nContact:  \nFor clarification, liaise with Ms. Zhao Lin (Corporate Security, ext. 1203) or email Zhao.Lin@sunrise-tech.cn.  \n\nNote: Always validate new vendor accounts through the ERP system (Vendor Code: KST-SH-ACU01) prior to disbursing funds.  \n\n---  \nThis notification is part of Sunrise Tech\u2019s fraud prevention training.

The representative referenced her recent browsing activity on the brand\u2019s high-end handbag collection and offered VIP consultation services. Miss Zhang provided her contact number (139-2319-1122) and budget (\u00a520,000) to schedule a personalized shopping plan.  \n\nRed Flags Identified  \n1. Unsolicited Contact: Legitimate luxury brands rarely initiate contact via phone or message to request personal details unless explicitly authorized by the client.  \n2. Premature Data Collection: The agent prioritized collecting contact information and budget before discussing product details or verifying account ownership.  \n3. Urgency Tactics: Immediate follow-up promises (e.g., \"contact you immediately\") are often used to pressure disclosure of sensitive data.  \n4. Domain Inconsistency: The brand name \"Lu9uryBoutique\" contains a non-standard character (\"9\" replacing \"x\"), which may indicate spoofing.  \n\nPreventative Recommendations  \n- Verify Identity: Confirm the representative\u2019s legitimacy by cross-referencing their contact details with the official Lu9uryBoutique website (www.luxuryboutique.com, service hotline: 400-812-3122).  \n- Avoid Sharing Personal Data: Never disclose contact information, financial details, or passwords to unverified sources.  \n- Report Suspicious Activity: Forward suspicious communications to security@luxuryboutique.com or contact the brand\u2019s fraud prevention team directly.  \n\nOfficial Reminder  \nLu9uryBoutique adheres to strict client privacy protocols. All consultations require prior opt-in consent, and payment discussions occur exclusively through secure channels.

The details provided include a deposit of 800 RMB followed by two additional exam fees (2500 RMB and 7500 RMB). This activity matches known patterns of fraudulent schemes.  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Upfront Deposit Requirement: Legitimate driving schools in Guangdong typically collect fees in person or through verified platforms, not via direct transfers to personal/unofficial accounts.  \n2. Unusual Fee Structure: Provincial regulations cap B1 license exam fees at 5800 RMB total. The quoted amount (10,800 RMB) significantly exceeds standard rates.  \n3. Proxy Exam Service Claims: Licensing exams require in-person attendance at designated centers. Third parties cannot legally \"arrange exams\" on behalf of applicants.  \n4. Receipt Submission Pressure: Fraudulent actors often demand proof of transfer to validate unauthorized transactions.  \n\nImmediate Actions Recommended:  \n- Do not transfer funds or share personal/financial information.  \n- Contact the Heyuan Transport Bureau (0762-338-0837) to verify the driving school\u2019s credentials.  \n- Report this incident to Guangdong Provincial Bank\u2019s Fraud Department (24/7 Hotline: 400-955-0837) or visit your nearest branch.  \n\nOfficial Verification Channels:  \n- Huancheng Driving School (Legitimate Contact):  \n  Tel: 0762-338-0837 (Registered Business Line)  \n  Email: info@huancheng-driving-hy.cn  \n  Address: No. 112 Renmin Road, Yuancheng District, Heyuan City  \n\nFor your safety, we have temporarily flagged this recipient for review.

Please be advised that Jingguang Driving School adheres strictly to legal protocols for all licensing procedures. Examinations must be attended in person, and no third-party service can bypass this requirement.  \n\nKey Details of the Suspicious Activity:  \n- Claim: A representative posing as \"Instructor Li\" contacted you, offering guaranteed exam passage without attendance.  \n- Requested Action: A deposit transfer (allegedly for \"record transfers\") to a private account (disclosed as Account No. 6214-8623-5701-3388, Bank: Huaxia Bank, Account Holder: Li Zhiming).  \n- Promised Outcome: Delivery of a driver\u2019s license within two weeks post-payment.  \n\nIdentified Red Flags:  \n1. Guaranteed Results: Legitimate driving schools cannot guarantee exam outcomes or bypass attendance mandates.  \n2. Upfront Payment Demands: Licensing fees are paid directly to authorized institutions, not private accounts.  \n3. Unofficial Communication: Official correspondence will only originate from verified channels (e.g., jgds@jingguang-driving.cn or +86-10-5862-3007).  \n4. Pressure to Act Quickly: Fraudsters often create urgency to prevent victims from verifying claims.  \n\nProtective Measures Recommended:  \n1. Cease Communication: Do not respond to unsolicited calls/messages.  \n2. Verify Payments: Confirm all transactions through the official school portal ([www.jingguang-driving.cn/payments](http://www.jingguang-driving.cn/payments)).  \n3. Report Suspicious Activity: Forward any fraudulent correspondence to fraudreport@jingguang-driving.cn or contact our Compliance Team at +86-10-5862-3009.  \n4. Secure Personal Data: Never share ID numbers, banking details, or exam records via unsecured channels.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf you have already transferred funds, contact your bank immediately to dispute the transaction.

Unsolicited Contact:  \n   - The florist initiated contact without prior referral or confirmation of the client\u2019s public inquiry. Legitimate vendors typically require verification of client intent before requesting personal contact details.  \n\n2. Immediate Request for Personal Communication:  \n   - Directing the conversation to WeChat (a private platform) bypasses formal business channels. Reputable professionals often use verified company emails, websites, or official business accounts for initial discussions.  \n\n3. Overly Generic Claims:  \n   - Phrases like \u201cbest floral design services\u201d lack specificity. Authentic vendors usually reference portfolios, reviews, or tailored proposals to establish credibility.  \n\n4. Rapid Disclosure of Contact Information:  \n   - Sharing a personal WeChat ID (13872751122) without verifying the vendor\u2019s identity or business license increases exposure to phishing, fake payment links, or unauthorized data collection.  \n\n---  \n\nRecommendations for Safe Engagement:  \n- Confirm the vendor\u2019s legitimacy via a registered business license or physical address.  \n- Use secure payment methods (e.g., platform escrow services) and avoid transferring deposits via private messaging apps.  \n- Cross-check contact details through official websites or trusted directories.  \n\n---  \n\nContact Verification:  \nFor inquiries, reach out to the Wedding Services Fraud Prevention Team at support@weddingsafety.cn or call +86 10 9501 3278 (9:00 AM \u2013 6:00 PM, Mon-Fri).  \n\nAlways safeguard personal information.

The agent claimed full compensation required Ms. Guo to transfer 12,340 yuan via Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) online banking to a \"designated account\" (Account Name: Li Wei, Account Number: 6217 8555 1122 0922 932) for \"account verification.\"  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified  \n1. Unrequested Transfer Demands: Legitimate postal services never require upfront payments or transfers to process compensations.  \n2. Suspicious Account Details: The provided account is a personal savings account, not an official corporate account.  \n3. Urgency Pressure: The agent insisted on immediate action, a common tactic to bypass critical scrutiny.  \n4. Spoofed Identity: Fraudsters often mimic official entities using generic titles (e.g., \"Postal Express Agent\") without verified employee IDs or department contacts.  \n\nProtective Measures Advised  \n- Immediately cease any transfer activity.  \n- Contact Postal Express directly via official hotline: 95533 (China) or email customer.service@postal-express.cn to verify the claim.  \n- Report suspicious requests to local authorities and your bank\u2019s fraud department.  \n\nVerification Reference  \n- Legitimate Postal Express protocols require in-person verification at a branch or via the official app (downloadable from www.postal-express.cn).  \n- Compensation disbursements are processed only after formal claim approval and issued directly to the sender/receiver\u2019s registered account.  \n\nContact for Clarification  \nPostal Express Fraud Prevention Team  \nTel: 010-6122 0922 (Beijing HQ, Mon-Fri 9:00 AM\u20136:00 PM CST)  \nEmail: antifraud@postal-express.cn  \nCase ID: PE-2023-10-0157  \n\nThis notice is generated for fraud awareness training.

Below is a summary of the scenario for your review:  \n\n---  \n\nScenario Details:  \nA caller claiming to be \"Xiao Liu\" from 66 Telecom contacted you regarding a \"free 5G network upgrade.\" You were informed that you had been selected as a \"lucky user\" and asked to provide your ID number (410761830613167) to confirm participation. The agent stated that processing the upgrade required signing an electronic agreement after verifying your personal information.  \n\n---  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unsolicited Requests for Sensitive Information: Legitimate telecom providers will never ask for full ID numbers, passwords, or banking details via unscheduled calls.  \n2. \"Too Good to Be True\" Offers: Phrases like \"lucky user\" or \"free upgrades\" are commonly used in phishing scams to create false urgency.  \n3. Spoofed Branding: Fraudsters often mimic official branding (e.g., \"66 Telecom\") but use unofficial contact channels (e.g., personal phone numbers or non-corporate email domains).  \n4. Electronic Agreement Pressure: Requests to sign documents hastily, especially without prior written notice, are a tactic to bypass your scrutiny.  \n\n---  \n\nPreventive Measures:  \n- Verify unsolicited calls by contacting 66 Telecom\u2019s official helpline at 400-800-66 (Mainland China) or email customercare@66telecom-official.com.  \n- Never share ID numbers, SMS verification codes, or account PINs with unknown callers.  \n- Report suspicious activity immediately to the Anti-Fraud Hotline: 96110.  \n\n---  \n\nThis notification is part of 66 Telecom\u2019s ongoing fraud prevention efforts.

Below is a summary of the incident for your awareness and action:  \n\nIncident Summary:  \nAn individual claiming to be a military officer (\"Zhanlang,\" account holder on \"Youke Youxin\") initiated contact via text, proposing friendship and subsequent investment opportunities. You were instructed to:  \n1. Download the \"Youke Youxin\" and \"Leidian Cloud Phone\" apps.  \n2. Log into the latter using shared credentials (account: [withheld], password: [withheld]).  \n3. Follow a link to invest in medicinal materials via bank transfers to unspecified accounts.  \n4. Continue transferring funds under persistent encouragement despite expressing unease.  \n\nKey Fraud Indicators:  \n- Unsolicited Military Identity: Fraudsters often impersonate authority figures (e.g., soldiers) to exploit trust.  \n- Third-Party App Requests: Legitimate institutions never require downloads of unverified apps for communication or investments.  \n- Shared Account Access: Providing personal login credentials violates standard security protocols.  \n- High-Return Pressure: Urgency to transfer funds repeatedly, with promises of disproportionate profits, is a hallmark of investment scams.  \n\nPotential Risks:  \n- Financial loss from irreversible transfers.  \n- Unauthorized data access via compromised apps.  \n- Further targeting by coordinated scam networks.  \n\nRecommendations:  \n1. Cease Communication: Block all contact with \"Zhanlang\" and associated accounts.  \n2. Freeze Transactions: Notify your bank immediately to halt further transfers (reference: FA-20231025-0893).  \n3. Report Apps: Delete \"Youke Youxin\" and \"Leidian Cloud Phone,\" then report them to your device\u2019s app store.  \n4.

Below is a detailed summary of the event for your records:  \n\nIncident Summary:  \nOn 2025-02-09, an individual impersonating law enforcement contacted you, alleging your parents were involved in illegal activities and demanding an immediate deposit of \u00a550,000 to avoid legal action. The perpetrator instructed you to:  \n1. Log into a specified Kuaishou account using your father\u2019s device, recharge \u00a0922, and complete 19 transactions of \u00a5688 each via a live-stream room.  \n2. Uninstall Kuaishou, register an Alipay account with your father\u2019s phone number, and disclose the payment password (914433).  \n3. Uninstall Alipay after account setup, then click on embedded payment links to complete transactions totaling \u00a51,399 and \u00a5999.  \n4. Delete all chat records, remove the perpetrator\u2019s WeChat contact, and refrain from discussing the matter.  \n\nKey Observations:  \n- Tactic Used: Fraudsters often exploit urgency and authority (e.g., impersonating officials) to pressure victims into bypassing standard financial safeguards.  \n- Red Flags: Requests for password disclosure, repeated uninstallation/reinstallation of apps, and demands for secrecy are hallmark indicators of fraud.  \n\nImmediate Recommendations:  \n1. Freeze Financial Accounts: Contact your bank and Alipay\u2019s support team (Service Hotline: 95188) to secure compromised accounts.  \n2. Report to Authorities: File a formal report with your local police department and provide all transaction records.  \n3. Device Security Scan: Perform a full malware check on your father\u2019s phone to eliminate potential spyware.  \n\nConsultation Support:  \nFor further assistance, contact our Fraud Prevention Team:  \n- Hotline: 400-821-6641 (24/7)  \n- Email: fraudprevention@official.alert.cn  \n- Case Reference ID: [Case ID: FPA-20231015-1147Z]  \n\nNote: Legitimate authorities will never demand payments via social media, instruct password sharing, or pressure you into secrecy.

Below are the details of the activity for your immediate review:  \n\nTransaction Summary:  \n- Seller Identity: Individual claiming to be \"Veteran Zhang Fei\" (retired military personnel).  \n- Product Offered: Military surplus equipment, including a \"tactical backpack\" advertised at a \"comrade discount\" of \u00a5500 (originally \u00a5800).  \n- Communication Channel: Unsolicited contact via social media (WeChat ID: 13800138000).  \n- Key Risk Indicators:  \n  - Use of emotional appeals (\"we\u2019re all comrades here\") and urgency (\"keep it confidential\").  \n  - Request for off-platform transactions (no secure payment gateway).  \n  - Unverifiable seller credentials and restricted military equipment sales (civilian transactions of such items are illegal in China).  \n\nClarifications for Awareness:  \n1. Military Equipment Sales: Legitimate military surplus is never sold through private social media accounts. Authorized vendors operate via government-approved platforms.  \n2. Confidentiality Pressure: Fraudsters often misuse terms like \"low-key\" or \"confidential\" to deter victims from verifying their claims.  \n3. Too-Good-to-Be-True Pricing: Significant discounts (e.g., 37% reduction) on specialty goods are typical red flags for counterfeit or non-existent products.  \n\nRecommended Actions:  \n1. Do Not share personal/financial details or proceed with payment.  \n2. Report the WeChat account via Tencent\u2019s reporting portal and block further contact.  \n3.

These apps claim to offer high-return investments with \u201csmall initial deposits\u201d and encourage collaborative participation. Below is a breakdown of key red flags to help you assess the legitimacy of this offer:  \n\n1. Unverified Third-Party Platforms:  \n   - These apps are not registered with the SEC or FINRA, nor are they affiliated with recognized financial institutions.  \n   - Legitimate trading platforms typically provide transparent licensing information, which is absent here.  \n\n2. Pressure to \u201cStart Small\u201d:  \n   - Fraudulent schemes often encourage low-risk \u201ctrial\u201d investments to build trust before escalating requests.  \n\n3. Unsolicited Contact:  \n   - The message appears to originate from a personal contact (e.g., \u201cDear, I found\u2026\u201d) rather than a professional entity, increasing the risk of social engineering.  \n\n4. Lack of Technical Safeguards:  \n   - The apps\u2019 download links are not available on official app stores, bypassing standard security vetting processes.  \n\nImmediate Action Steps:  \n- Do not share personal or financial details, including passwords or account numbers.  \n- Verify unfamiliar platforms via official channels (e.g., FINRA\u2019s BrokerCheck or your bank\u2019s advisory team).  \n- Report suspicious activity to SunTrust\u2019s Security Department at 1-800-522-4026 (Mon\u2013Fri, 8 AM\u20138 PM EST) or security@suntrustbank.com.  \n\nFor your protection, we\u2019ve temporarily flagged transactions linked to unverified platforms.

We are offering a part-time remote job with daily settlement. Tasks involve purchasing USDT (Tether) via the 'Juliang' APP to generate profits. No prior experience required.  \nSteps to Join:  \n1.

Unverified Platforms: The \"Juliang\" app is not registered with financial regulators. Legitimate investment platforms disclose licensing details publicly.  \n2. Guaranteed High Returns: Promises of 3\u20138% daily profits (over 1000% annualized) are unrealistic and align with Ponzi scheme structures.  \n3. Direct Contact via Social Media: Requests to communicate via WeChat/WhatsApp avoid official customer service channels, reducing traceability.  \n4. Urgency & Exclusivity: Pressure to act quickly (\"limited slots\") discourages due diligence.  \n\nAction Required:  \n- Do not download unverified apps or share personal/financial details.  \n- Report similar messages to our Security Team immediately via:  \n  - Email: security@bankofasia.com (Case #FPR-20231105-789)  \n  - Phone: +852 1234 5678 (Reference Code: JULIANG-ALERT)  \n\nYour vigilance protects our community.

Based on our analysis, these activities match patterns associated with fraudulent investment schemes. Below is a summary of the flagged activity for your review:  \n\n1. Investment Solicitation:  \n   - Platform: Weibo user \"@GlobalInvestPro\" (unverified account created July 2023).  \n   - Product: Software \"NFA\" (unregistered entity) promoted for \"internet acceleration\" and \"forex trading.\"  \n   - Initial Return: 14% profit (\u00a51,400) on a \u00a510,000 investment within 48 hours.  \n\n2. Red Flags Identified:  \n   - Unregulated Platform: NFA is not licensed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) or other regulatory bodies.  \n   - Pressure to Transfer Funds: Subsequent requests for \u00a528,500 to \"taxation accounts\" (e.g., 6214-1924-5567, Zhang Wei, Industrial Bank) and \"margin deposits.\"  \n   - Withdrawal Restrictions: Claims of \"system errors\" and \"audit fees\" when attempting to withdraw profits.  \n\n3. Recommendations:  \n   - Immediate Action: Cease further transfers and contact TD Bank\u2019s Fraud Hotline at 400-810-9012.  \n   - Report to Authorities: File a report with the local Public Security Bureau\u2019s Economic Crime Division (reference case template provided [here](http://www.tdbank.com.cn/fraudreport)).  \n   - Secure Accounts: Temporarily freeze transactions via our mobile app (Settings > Security Center > Suspend Transactions).  \n\nContact Verification:  \nFor confirmation, our staff will contact you via SMS from 1069-555-TDBank or email from antifraud@tdbank.com.cn within 24 hours.

Urgency & Quota Pressure: Phrases like \u201cact quickly\u201d and \u201creserved quota\u201d manipulate urgency.  \n3. Incremental Transfers: Requiring repeated payments (38 transfers) is a hallmark of pyramid schemes.  \n4. Spoofed Domains: The link uses a non-standard subdomain (\u201cdsjj.boshi\u201d), inconsistent with Bosera Fund\u2019s official channels.  \n5. Unverifiable Contacts: The phone number and email, while plausible, cannot be cross-referenced with public records.  \n\nThis test evaluates recognition of urgency tactics, suspicious payment structures, and domain spoofing.",

The fraudulent message claims that investing through the \"Yixin\" APP (downloadable via an unverified link) guarantees \"high returns\" and instructs recipients to follow the sender\u2019s directions.  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unauthorized Communication: The message was not distributed through official bank channels. Pacific Trust Bank does not endorse third-party apps for investment purposes.  \n2. Unverified Links: The download link for \"Yixin\" has not been reviewed by our IT Security team and may expose devices to malware.  \n3. High-Return Promises: Claims of guaranteed profits are inconsistent with legitimate investment practices and typical of Ponzi schemes.  \n4. Instruction-Based Actions: Legitimate financial institutions will never ask employees to bypass standard protocols via informal instructions.  \n\nRequired Action:  \n- Do not click any links or download the app.  \n- Forward the original message (including headers) to phishing.report@PacificTrust.bank or call the Internal Fraud Hotline at 1-800-555-0199 (ext. 7302).  \n- If you have already engaged with the link, immediately disconnect your device from the network and contact IT Support (support@PacificTrust.bank).  \n\nReminder:  \nAll investment products endorsed by Pacific Trust Bank undergo rigorous vetting and are accessible only through secure client portals. Report any unsolicited financial offers to the Security Team within 24 hours.  \n\nSincerely,  \nLiam Carter  \nHead of Cybersecurity & Fraud Prevention  \nPacific Trust Bank  \n---  \nThis is an automated alert.

Reset Your Password: If you shared your credentials, immediately update your password via the Security Settings section of your account.  \n2.

Below is a summary of the flagged interaction for your review:  \n\n Fraudulent Offer Details:  \n  - Claim: \"Exclusive software to predict stock market trends with high accuracy.\"  \n  - Requested Action: Registration on an unverified third-party website (www.global-investmenthub.co) and an initial investment of \u00a586,000.  \n  - Promised Returns: Guaranteed profits, urgency to invest, and encouragement to increase funds for \"greater returns.\"  \n\n---\n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unrealistic Promises: No legitimate software can \"accurately predict\" stock market movements. High-return guarantees with minimal risk are hallmark signs of fraud.  \n2. Pressure to Act Quickly: Scammers often create false urgency to prevent victims from verifying claims.  \n3. Unsecured Platform: The provided website lacks HTTPS encryption and is not registered under any recognized financial regulatory authority.  \n4. Withdrawal Risks: Fraudulent platforms often delay or block withdrawals after funds are deposited.  \n\n---\n\nRecommended Actions:  \n1. Do Not Engage Further: Cease all communication with the individual claiming to be an \"investment advisor\" (Contact: +86 132-9253-7632 | Email: service@globalinvest-software.cn).  \n2. Verify Legitimacy: Cross-check investment platforms with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) official registry.  \n3. Secure Your Accounts: If you shared banking details, contact your financial institution immediately to monitor for unauthorized transactions.  \n4.

The caller referenced an incomplete loan application and offered a low-interest loan contingent upon providing personal information and activating a tax account via WeChat. Below is a detailed analysis of the interaction to help identify potential fraud indicators.  \n\n---  \n\nRed Flags Identified  \n1. Unsolicited Contact:  \n   - Legitimate financial institutions, including WeBank, will not proactively contact customers via phone or social platforms to request sensitive information or account activation.  \n\n2. Urgency and Flattery Tactics:  \n   - The mention of \"excellent credit records\" and immediate loan approval is often used to lower vigilance. Authentic loan approvals require formal verification processes, not instant offers during unscheduled calls.  \n\n3. Request for Tax Account Activation:  \n   - Tax-related account activation or verification is never conducted through third-party platforms like WeChat. Official procedures are handled via secure banking portals or in-person verification.  \n\n4. Channel of Communication:  \n   - WeBank does not guide customers through loan processes via WeChat. Official transactions occur through the bank\u2019s app, verified website, or branch offices.  \n\n5. Security Reassurance Without Verification:  \n   - Phishing attempts often emphasize \"account security\" to create false trust. Always verify the caller\u2019s identity through official channels before proceeding.  \n\n---  \n\nProtective Measures  \n- Verify Suspicious Contacts: Cross-check any unsolicited communication via WeBank\u2019s official customer service hotline: 400-800-9553 (24/7).  \n- Avoid Sharing Sensitive Data: Never disclose ID numbers, bank details, or tax information over unverified channels.  \n- Report Phishing Attempts: Forward suspicious messages or call logs to security@webank.com with the subject line \"Fraud Report \u2013 Case ID [WB20231015-456HL].\"  \n\n---  \n\nOfficial Reminder  \nWeBank adheres to strict data protection protocols. For loan applications or account updates, visit our official website (www.webank.com) or use the WeBank App (verified publisher: \"WeBank Co., Ltd.\").  \n\n---  \nThis notification is generated for fraud awareness training. Details are fictional but reflect real-world scam patterns.",

Below is a simulated scenario based on real-world fraud tactics. Please review carefully to identify red flags.  \n\n---  \n\nScenario Overview  \nSource: Unsolicited contact via WeChat (user ID: Zhenai_John88) claiming to be a \"friend\" from Zhenai.com.  \nPlatform Recommended: \"Quark Investment App\" (downloaded from an app store).  \nInstructions Provided:  \n1. Log in to Quark and navigate to URL \"/6.\"  \n2. Deposit \u00a55,000 initially, then escalate investments under customer service guidance (contact: CS_Quark@tutanota.com / +86 400-662-2658).  \n3. Early returns displayed to build trust, followed by pressure to reinvest larger sums.  \n\n---  \n\nKey Red Flags to Identify  \n1. Unsolicited Investment Advice: Legitimate advisors rarely initiate contact via social platforms.  \n2. Third-Party App Risks: \"Quark\" is unverified; legitimate platforms do not require accessing hidden URLs (e.g., \"/6\").  \n3. Urgency & Secrecy: Pressure to act quickly, avoid scrutiny, or bypass standard procedures.  \n4. Too-Good-To-Be-True Returns: Early \"returns\" are often fabricated to lure larger deposits.  \n5. Untraceable Contacts: Use of disposable email domains (e.g., Tutanota) and non-fixed phone numbers.  \n\n---  \n\nActionable Steps for Verification  \n- Contact Institutions Directly: Use official channels (e.g., bank hotline, in-person branch) to confirm investment legitimacy.  \n- Verify URLs/Apps: Cross-check with regulatory bodies (e.g., China Securities Regulatory Commission).  \n- Report Suspicious Activity: Forward details to your bank\u2019s fraud department (e.g., security@yourbank.com / +86 21-95552).  \n\n---  \n\nTest Conclusion  \nThis exercise aims to reinforce vigilance against social engineering tactics. Always validate unsolicited financial opportunities through independent channels.  \n\nIssued By: Financial Security Team  \nDate: June 5, 2024  \nReference Code: FA-20240605-ZW1123  \n\n(Note: All names, contact details, and platforms are fictional for training purposes.)",

Below are critical details for your immediate awareness:  \n\n1. Fraudulent Activity Overview  \n- Entity Name: \"Investment Treasure\" APP (unregistered platform).  \n- Claimed Affiliation: \"Stock Investment Mentor Team\" (no verifiable regulatory registration).  \n- Key Red Flags:  \n  - Requests to transfer funds to third-party corporate accounts (e.g., Shanghai Dongsheng Industrial Co., Ltd. or Shanghai Canzhang Technology Co., Ltd.).  \n  - Promises of \"high returns\" with guaranteed results, coupled with pressure to reinvest to resolve withdrawal delays.  \n  - Use of non-bank payment channels and absence of secure, auditable transaction records.  \n\n2. Confirmed Indicators of Fraud  \n- Fake Corporate Accounts: Legitimate investment platforms never direct clients to transfer funds to unrelated corporate accounts.  \n- Withdrawal Restrictions: Delays or excuses preventing withdrawals (e.g., \"system processing\") are classic tactics to retain illicit funds.  \n- No Regulatory Compliance: The platform lacks licenses from financial authorities (e.g., SEC, FINRA).  \n\n3. Immediate Actions Recommended:  \n- Cease Communication: Do not engage further with any representatives of \"Investment Treasure.\"  \n- Contact Financial Institutions: Notify your bank or payment provider to freeze transactions involving the listed accounts.  \n- Report to Authorities: File a report with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) via [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](http://www.ReportFraud.ftc.gov) or the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at [IC3.gov](http://www.IC3.gov).  \n- Monitor Accounts: Check for unauthorized transactions and update your account security credentials.  \n\n4. Verification Assistance  \nFor urgent concerns, contact our Fraud Prevention Team:  \n- Phone: +1 (800) 555-0198 (Mon-Fri, 8:00 AM \u2013 8:00 PM EST).  \n- Email: support@finregulatory.org (Include Reference ID in subject line).  \n\n---  \n\nNote: This notification is automated for your protection.

Fraudulent Request Details:  \n   - Claimed Representative: \"John Lee,\" purportedly from Sea Elephant Finance Customer Service.  \n   - Communicated Demand: A tax payment of \u00a590,000 (20% of the investment amount) was requested to \"initiate\" your withdrawal.  \n   - Designated Account: A personal bank account (Acct.

Key Red Flags Identified:  \n   - Upfront Payment Demands: Legitimate financial platforms never require upfront tax payments or fees to process withdrawals.  \n   - Urgency and Pressure: Fraudsters often insist on immediate transfers to prevent victims from verifying claims.  \n   - Mismatched Accounts: Official institutions do not use personal bank accounts for corporate transactions.  \n   - Escalating Fees: Repeated demands for additional payments under vague pretexts (e.g., \"offset,\" \"system errors\") are hallmarks of scams.  \n\n3.

Initial Contact: Agent Zhang Wei contacted Ms. Li via SMS (+86 138 5678 4321) offering a loan guarantor service, requiring a \u00a52,000 deposit.  \n2. Discount Incentive: Agent reduced deposit to \u00a51,900 upon hesitation, directing payment via Cloud Flash Payment to ICBC account 6212 2612 3456 7890 (Account Holder: Shanghai Tengfei Consulting Co., Ltd.).  \n3. Post-Payment Demands: After receiving \u00a51,900, Agent Zhang claimed the full \u00a54,000 was required for guarantor activation. Ms. Li paid an additional \u00a51,200.  \n4. Guarantor Contact: Agent provided QQ number (30576) for \"Wang Ming,\" who scheduled a meeting but blocked Ms. Li post-payment.  \n\n---  \n\nFraud Indicators Analysis:  \n1. Unsolicited Contact: Legitimate financial institutions do not initiate loan services via unsolicited SMS/calls.  \n2. Upfront Fees: Requests for deposits or \"security fees\" prior to service delivery violate standard lending protocols.  \n3. Pressure Tactics: Time-sensitive discounts (e.g., \"pay now for reduced deposit\") aim to bypass due diligence.  \n4. Mismatched Accounts: Discrepancy between company name (Shanghai Tengfei Consulting) and purported financial service.  \n5. Ghost Guarantor: Use of non-official communication channels (e.g., QQ) and blocked contact post-payment.  \n\n---  \n\nTest Questions:  \n1. Which red flag in Step 2 suggests the agent is not affiliated with a legitimate institution?  \n2. Why is the request for payment to a corporate account (Shanghai Tengfei Consulting) suspicious in this context?  \n3. What precaution should Ms. Li have taken before transferring funds?  \n\n---  \n\nPrevention Guidelines:  \n- Verify financial service licenses via official platforms (e.g., CBIRC.gov.cn).  \n- Reject unsolicited payment requests via personal/non-corporate accounts.  \n- Use secure channels (e.g., bank branches, verified apps) for transactions.  \n\nReporting Contacts:  \n- ICBC Fraud Hotline: 95588 (official)  \n- Cybersecurity Report Email: report@antifraud.gov.cn (simulated)  \n\n---  \nThis case simulates real-world scam patterns for training purposes.

Unverified Lender: Legitimate financial institutions provide registration details (e.g., FCA ID: 123456) and physical office addresses. This entity lists only a generic email and mobile number.  \n2. Pressure to Share Sensitive Data: Reputable lenders require formal applications through secure portals, not ad hoc requests via email/phone.  \n3. Vague Loan Terms: Authentic offers disclose exact rates, fees, and repayment schedules upfront (e.g., \"5.8% fixed APR over 10 years\").  \n4. Unsolicited Outreach: Professional immigration advisors do not cold-contact clients to propose loans without prior consultation.  \n\n---  \nAction Required:  \nIf you did not initiate this request, immediately:  \n1. Do not share personal/financial information.  \n2. Report the interaction to the GFPB via secure portal: https://reportfraud.gfpb.org/case-87654321  \n3.

You were instructed to download the \"Shimi Da\" app for communication and transfer \u00a550,000 to an unspecified account for \"joint operations.\" The agent emphasized urgency, guaranteed returns, and directed you to a third-party link for transactions.  \n\n---  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified  \n1. Unsolicited Contact: Legitimate financial advisors do not initiate contact via informal platforms (e.g., social media, messaging apps).  \n2. Urgency and Secrecy: Pressure to act quickly (\"transfer funds immediately\") and avoid scrutiny is a hallmark of fraud.  \n3. Unverified Apps/Platforms: Requests to download non-mainstream apps (e.g., \"Shimi Da\") for financial transactions are high-risk.  \n4. Guaranteed High Returns: Claims of \"quick returns\" with minimal risk are unrealistic and indicative of scams.  \n5. Upfront Payment Demands: Legitimate investments never require transferring funds to personal or unregulated accounts before due diligence.  \n\n---  \n\nImmediate Protective Measures  \n- Cease Communication: Block the agent\u2019s contact details and uninstall \"Shimi Da.\"  \n- Freeze Transactions: Contact your bank immediately to halt the \u00a550,000 transfer if possible.  \n- Verify Legitimacy: Cross-check investment platforms with official regulatory databases (e.g., China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission).  \n\n---  \n\nVerification Steps for Future Reference  \n1.

This transaction was initiated after you registered on an app named \u201cThunder Cloud Phone\u201d following guidance from an individual claiming to represent Quanmin K Ge (user ID: Steel Bone).  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1.

Direct Transfer to Personal Account: Funds were directed to a private bank account instead of a regulated trading platform. Licensed brokers never require transfers to personal accounts.  \n4. Guaranteed Returns: Claims of \u201censuring fund safety and generating profits\u201d are unrealistic and indicative of high-risk scams.  \n\nRecommended Actions:  \n1.

No: UB-FPA-231018  \nCustomer Name: Mr. James Lin  \nContact: 1-800-555-0199 | fraudprevention@unitybank.com  \n\n---  \n\nSubject: Urgent Review of Recent Transaction Activity  \n\nDear Mr. Lin,  \n\nOur system has flagged unusual activity involving transfers from your account ending in \u2022\u2022\u20227124 to an external bank account (5609, Qulang Investment Platform). Below is a summary of the transactions for your immediate review:  \n\n1. October 15, 2023: Outbound transfer of \u00a5508.00 to Qulang APP (recipient: Zhang Wei, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China).  \n2. October 16, 2023: Transfer of \u00a51,088.00 to the same recipient.  \n3. October 17, 2023: Two transfers totaling \u00a517,676.00 (\u00a55,088.00 and \u00a512,588.00).  \n\nObserved Red Flags:  \n- Guaranteed High Returns: Promises of \"30% profit with no risk\" violate standard investment principles. Legitimate investments disclose risks and do not guarantee returns.  \n- Pressure to Escalate Investments: Urgency to reinvest larger sums (e.g., \"Invest \u00a526,880 to withdraw\") is a common tactic to exploit victims.  \n- Unverified Third-Party Links: Instructions to use non-secure external platforms for tracking investments lack accountability.  \n- Withdrawal Delays: Artificial balance increases (e.g., \u00a525,650 displayed) with repeated excuses to block withdrawals.  \n\nValidation Test:  \n1. Which of the following is not a red flag in this scenario?  \n   A) Guaranteed high returns with no risk  \n   B) Pressure to reinvest larger amounts  \n   C) Use of a bank-verified payment gateway  \n   D) Delayed withdrawal approvals  \n\n2. What immediate action should be taken if a platform demands additional payments to access funds?  \n   A) Contact your bank to freeze the account  \n   B) Comply to recover prior investments  \n   C) Ignore the request and cease communication  \n\nNext Steps:  \n- Cease all further transactions with Qulang APP.  \n- Contact Unity Bank Fraud Prevention via the number above to secure your account.  \n- File a report with local authorities using transaction records (attached).  \n\nSincerely,  \nSophia Chen  \nSenior Fraud Analyst, Unity Bank  \n24/7 Support Line: 1-800-555-0199  \n\n---  \nThis advisory is automated for your protection.

Below is a simulated scenario based on real-world fraud tactics. Please review carefully to enhance your awareness:  \n\n---\n\nScenario Summary  \nCaller Identity: Li Hua, claiming to represent \"Green Future Investments.\"  \nCommunication Channel: Unsolicited phone call.  \nRequest: Urged you to download a dedicated app via a provided link to \"manage investments in a green energy project,\" promising real-time tracking of returns.  \n\nKey Red Flags  \n1. Unsolicited Contact: Legitimate financial institutions will not pressure clients to download apps or share personal information via unprompted calls.  \n2. Unverified Links: Links sent directly by unknown agents may lead to phishing sites or malicious software.  \n3. Too-Good-to-Be-True Claims: Promises of high returns with minimal risk, especially in \"revolutionary\" projects, are common in investment scams.  \n4. Immediate Action Pressure: Fraudsters often create urgency to bypass your due diligence.  \n\nSecurity Analysis  \n- App Risks: Unofficial apps may harvest login credentials or install malware.  \n- Data Exposure: Entering investment details (e.g., account numbers, passwords) into unverified platforms risks identity theft.  \n- Entity Verification: \"Green Future Investments\" is not registered with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).  \n\nRecommended Actions  \n1. Terminate Communication: End the call immediately.  \n2. Verify Independently: Contact your bank or financial advisor using official channels (e.g., ICBC\u2019s verified hotline: 95588) to confirm the legitimacy of any unsolicited offer.  \n3. Report Suspicious Activity: Forward details to ICBC\u2019s Fraud Prevention Team at security@icbc.com.cn or call 400-669-5566.  \n\n---\n\nSecure Banking Reminder  \nICBC will never request app downloads, passwords, or sensitive data via links in unsolicited messages. Always authenticate third-party investment platforms through official regulatory databases.  \n\nStay vigilant to protect your assets.  \n\nBest regards,  \nICBC Security Operations Center  \nHotline: 95588 (24/7)  \nOfficial Website: www.icbc.com.cn  \n\nNote: This notification is for educational purposes.

Fund Transfers to Personal Accounts:  \n   Legitimate financial institutions will never request direct transfers to personal bank accounts. All transactions should be processed through secure, institution-owned platforms with verifiable credentials.  \n\n2. High-Return Promises:  \n   Be cautious of unsolicited offers guaranteeing \"considerable returns\" in volatile markets like oil trading. Authentic advisors provide balanced risk assessments, not absolute profit assurances.  \n\n3. Phased Withdrawal Restrictions:  \n   Fraudulent platforms often permit initial withdrawals to build trust before blocking access under false pretenses (e.g., system maintenance, compliance checks).  \n\nImmediate Action Steps:  \n- Verify Platform Legitimacy: Confirm Futu Securities\u2019 regulatory status via the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) website [www.sfc.hk].  \n- Contact Support: For urgent concerns, reach our Compliance Team at +852 5809 3271 or compliance@fututrade.hk.  \n- Report Suspicious Activity: Notify your local financial authority if you suspect fraudulent behavior.  \n\nFraud Prevention Reminder:  \nAlways validate investment opportunities through independent regulatory databases.

The activity matches a known fraud template involving unauthorized interest rate adjustment schemes. Below is a detailed summary of the flagged interaction for your immediate review:  \n\n---  \n\nSuspicious Activity Report  \n- Claimed Representative: JD Finance Customer Service (Unverified)  \n- Contact Method: WeChat (ID: w6id-10297, Nickname: 10297)  \n- Requested Actions:  \n  1. Download third-party apps: \"Xiao Yu Yi Lian\" and \"Le Bo Tou Ping\" (Unverified, Non-JD Platforms).  \n  2. Transfer funds via multiple bank accounts (Pudong Development Bank, ICBC, Bank of Communications) to external accounts (CCB, ABC, Yunnan Rural Credit Cooperative).  \n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unauthorized Communication Channels: JD Finance does not conduct official business via personal WeChat accounts or third-party apps. Legitimate representatives will only contact you through JD\u2019s verified platforms (app, official hotline 400-603-3600, or email @jdcs.com).  \n2. Unverified Tools: The requested apps are not affiliated with JD and may contain malware designed to steal financial data.  \n3. Illegitimate Transfer Requests: Adjusting interest rates requires no fund transfers. Any request to move money to \"secure\" or \"verification\" accounts is fraudulent.  \n\n---  \n\nImmediate Steps to Protect Your Account:  \n1. Terminate Communication: Block the WeChat account (w6id-10297) and uninstall the unauthorized apps.  \n2. Freeze Transactions: Contact your bank to halt transfers and report the recipient accounts as suspicious.  \n3. Verify Legitimacy: Forward all related messages to JD\u2019s Security Team at security@jdfinance.com or call 400-603-3600 (24/7).  \n\n---  \n\nReminder: JD Finance will never ask for sensitive information, app downloads, or fund transfers outside our official channels.

This activity matches patterns associated with a widespread fraud scheme. Below are critical details to help you recognize and avoid such scams:  \n\n---\n\nScam Overview:  \n1. Initial Contact: Fraudsters pose as \"task agents\" via SMS, social media, or messaging apps, offering easy income for simple tasks (e.g., liking Douyin videos for \u00a515\u2013\u00a550 rewards).  \n2. Escalation to High-Risk Tasks: After minor payouts to build trust, victims are pressured into \"advanced tasks\" requiring upfront payments or investments (e.g., \"data entry,\" \"account upgrades,\" or \"commission-based returns\").  \n3. Disappearance of Funds: Once large sums (often tens of thousands of yuan) are transferred, scammers delay payments with excuses (\"system errors,\" \"taxes\") or vanish entirely.  \n\n---\n\nKey Red Flags Observed in Your Case:  \n- Unsolicited offers for \"guaranteed income\" via unofficial platforms.  \n- Requests to contact \"staff\" through unverified channels (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp).  \n- Pressure to invest increasing amounts to \"unlock higher returns.\"  \n- Payments directed to personal accounts or unfamiliar third-party platforms.  \n\n---\n\nImmediate Actions Taken by ICBC:  \n1. Temporarily restricted transactions on your account pending verification.  \n2. Flagged recipient account (7139 \u674e\u4f1f) for further investigation.  \n\n---\n\nFraud Prevention Steps for You:  \n\u2705 Verify Unexpected Offers: Legitimate businesses will not ask for payments to release earnings.  \n\u2705 Avoid Clicking Suspicious Links: Phishing links often mimic official platforms to steal login credentials.  \n\u2705 Contact ICBC Directly: Use only official channels:  \n   - Phone: 95588 (Ext. 3 \u2013 Fraud Department)  \n   - Email: antifraud.service@icbc.com.cn  \n\n---\n\nNext Steps:  \n1.

Social Media Contact: Unsolicited messages via WeChat from an account named \"Little Ximi\" promoting high-return opportunities.  \n2. Public Accounts: Directed users to follow \"Qu Can Shu Information\" (\u53bb\u8695\u6570\u4fe1\u606f) and add the corporate account \"Wan Sheng Cultural Media\" (\u4e07\u76db\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u5a92).  \n3. Suspicious Software: Pressure to download an unnamed \"mysterious chat software\" and the cryptocurrency trading app \"Weisi Coin\" (\u7ef4\u65af\u5e01), claiming returns of 3-5x within 10 days (5 RMB/coin).  \n4. Payment Demand: Funds directed to Jiangxi Jingcheng Intellectual Property Service Co., Ltd. (\u6c5f\u897f\u666f\u57ce\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u670d\u52a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), Account: 6214 8501 0032 6688 992.  \n5.

Immediately Cease Communication with all listed accounts and uninstall unauthorized software.  \n2. Report Transactions: Contact your bank to freeze involved accounts and file a police report at the nearest Public Security Bureau.  \n3.

Transaction Summary  \n   - Platform: Carbon Yi Bao (claimed affiliation: \"Green Investment Projects\")  \n   - Activity: A transfer of \u00a515,000 was initiated to a personal bank account (ending in 7890) under the name \"Wang Jun.\"  \n   - Platform Communication:  \n     - You were instructed to \"recharge funds via app for equivalent points\" with a 1:1 withdrawal promise.  \n     - After transfer, the agent cited an \"account activation issue\" and requested a second payment.  \n\n2. Identified Red Flags  \n   - Unverified Recipient Account: Funds were directed to a personal account, not a corporate or escrow service.  \n   - Pressure to Re-transfer: Legitimate platforms resolve disputes through formal audits, not repeated payments.  \n   - Too-Good-to-Be-True Returns: Immediate point conversion and withdrawal guarantees are atypical for regulated investments.  \n\n3. Required Actions  \n   - Contact Your Bank: Immediately report this transaction to your bank\u2019s fraud department (e.g., call 1234# or visit your branch).  \n   - Cease Further Transfers: Do not send additional funds or share verification codes.  \n   - Report to Authorities: File a report with the National Anti-Fraud Hotline (95555) or local law enforcement.  \n\n4.

Below is an analysis of the interaction for your awareness:  \n\n---\n\nKey Red Flags Identified:  \n1. Unsolicited Financial Advice:  \n   The agent initiated contact claiming to represent a financial advisory service. Legitimate advisors never proactively solicit investments via unsolicited messages.  \n\n2. Guaranteed High Returns:  \n   Promises of \"doubled earnings\" or \"guaranteed returns\" are hallmarks of fraudulent schemes. Authentic investments carry risk and do not guarantee profits.  \n\n3. Third-Party App Pressure:  \n   The request to download \"OKEx\" (unaffiliated with regulated platforms like Yu'ebao) and immediate recharge demands are tactics to bypass secure banking channels.  \n\n4. Delayed Withdrawal Excuses:  \n   Claims of \"system delays\" to obstruct fund recovery are consistent with Ponzi schemes, where early investors are paid with deposits from new victims.  \n\n---\n\nImmediate Action Required:  \n- Cease Communication: Block the agent\u2019s contact details (e.g., +44 7700 900 or support@okex-invest.cc).  \n- Report Transactions: Contact your bank\u2019s fraud department via 0345 755 3222 or report via online banking.  \n- Verify Platforms: Cross-check app legitimacy via official sources (e.g., FCA Register).  \n\n---\n\nSantander Support Channels:  \n- 24/7 Fraud Hotline: 0800 9 123 123  \n- Secure Email: fraudprevention@security.santander.co.uk  \n- In-Branch Assistance: Visit your local branch with transaction references.  \n\nWe strongly advise reviewing our Investment Scam Guide [here](https://www.santander.co.uk/security-hub) for further protection steps.  \n\n---  \nYours sincerely,  \nSarah Bennett  \nHead of Fraud Prevention, Santander UK  \n[Santander Security Hub](https://www.santander.co.uk/security-hub) | [Privacy Policy](https://www.santander.co.uk/privacy-policy)  \n\nThis message is automated.

Our system detected interactions involving an unverified third party claiming to provide \"internal trading data\" via a social platform (Tantan), directing you to register through an external link, execute trades at specific times, and recharge funds repeatedly.  \n\nKey Event Summary:  \n1. Unsolicited Investment Offer: A user posing as a personal contact encouraged high-return trading using non-official channels.  \n2.

Below is a summary of the incident for your awareness and action:  \n\n1. Inquiry Details:  \n   - A self-claimed buyer (\"Agent\") representing China Railway Company contacted your team, stating they required a \"large order of specific red wines\" and inquired about stock availability.  \n   - Upon learning your store did not carry the requested product, the buyer recommended adding a WeChat account (ID: RedWine_Distributor_CN) belonging to an alleged third-party distributor.  \n   - The distributor later requested an upfront deposit of 10,000 CNY but became unresponsive after the transfer was completed.  \n\n2. Key Red Flags Identified:  \n   - Unverified Identity: The buyer\u2019s affiliation with China Railway Company was not independently validated.  \n   - Third-Party Referral: Pressure to engage with an unvetted external supplier via WeChat, a platform with limited transaction safeguards.  \n   - Advance Payment Demand: Requests for upfront deposits without contractual guarantees or escrow arrangements are high-risk.  \n\n3. Recommended Actions:  \n   - Immediate Verification: Contact China Railway Company directly via their official channels (+86-10-5184-7285 or procurement@crgc.cn) to confirm the legitimacy of the inquiry.  \n   - Report Suspicious Activity: Forward all related communications (WeChat IDs, transaction records) to our fraud investigation team at fraudreport@antifraud.cn or +86-21-6223-1285.  \n   - Cease Further Transactions: Halt any additional payments or engagements with the referenced distributor until authenticity is verified.  \n\nThis notification aims to enhance your vigilance against procurement scams.

Unverified Identity: The requester utilized informal channels (group chat) for financial instructions, bypassing standard authorization protocols.  \n2. Pressure Tactics: Repeated emphasis on urgency (e.g., \u201ctransfer directly,\u201d \u201churry up\u201d) to override due diligence.  \n3. Suspicious Account: External personal account provided for a corporate transaction.  \n\nRecommended Actions  \n1. Immediate Pause: Halt all transfers related to this request.  \n2. Verification: Contact your supervisor directly via verified company channels (e.g., internal phone extension 1023 or in person) to confirm legitimacy.  \n3. Report: Forward all related messages to the Security Department (security@yourcompany.com or hotline 400-810-8104) for investigation.  \n\nSecurity Reminder  \nLegitimate financial requests will never bypass standard approval workflows or pressure employees for urgent transfers. Always verify U-Shield-related requests through the Finance Department (finance-verify@yourcompany.com).  \n\nContact for Clarification  \n- Security Team: 400-810-0192 (24/7)  \n- Direct Supervisor: Zhang Wei, Extension 1023  \n\nThis notification is issued to ensure prompt awareness and resolution of potential fraud.

Our system flagged a communication where an individual claiming to be an \"idol manager\" offered direct contact via QQ (ID: [Automatically Generated: 123456789]). The representative further indicated that due to your minor status, legal repercussions could arise for your parents unless a financial resolution is arranged.

Unsecure Payment Link: The URL structure (\"67-ebookstore.cn\") mismatches the claimed brand name (\"67 eBook Store\"), suggesting a spoofed domain. Legitimate companies use consistent branding.  \n3. Data Request: Legitimate services rarely activate accounts via email replies. Sensitive actions occur through verified user portals.  \n4. Missing Verification: No mention of SSL encryption, third-party payment gateways (e.g., Alipay), or invoice documentation.  \n5. Sender Address: Generic email (support@67-ebookstore.com) lacks a personalized domain (e.g., @67ebookstore.com), common in phishing campaigns.  \n\nLegitimate Alternative: Always verify offers by logging into your account directly via the official website or app, avoiding links in unsolicited messages.",

The order included 12 AUX air conditioners (in-stock) and 4 Kstar units (requiring third-party procurement). Liu insisted on consolidating payments for both brands into a single transfer to \"simplify financial processing.\" The client was instructed to remit \u00a566,000 directly to a Kstar \"manufacturer\" (WeChat ID: Kstar_Manu_Official88) before Liu\u2019s payment cleared.

I noticed your post seeking tickets for Jay Chou\u2019s concert on October 15. I have 2 VIP tickets available and can transfer them via Xianyu. Click here to claim: [Xianyu Link: xianyu.com/ticket/8867].\"  \n\n2. Transaction Process:  \n   - Customer Action: The customer placed an order on Xianyu (Order ID: XY-20231015-8892).  \n   - Follow-Up Message: \"Your order lacks a name. Please resubmit and scan this WeChat QR code to pay the \u00a5300 deposit. [QR Code Image: pixelated graphic].\"  \n   - Escalation: After payment, the seller stated, \"To ensure secure delivery, an additional \u00a53,000 deposit is required. Funds will be refunded post-delivery.\" A third request for \u00a53,000 followed, citing \"anti-fraud verification.\"  \n\n3. Red Flags Identified:  \n   - Platform Violation: Legitimate Xianyu sellers process payments only through the app. External QR codes or direct transfers violate platform policies.  \n   - Urgency Tactics: The seller emphasized, \"Complete payment within 10 minutes or your order will be canceled.\"  \n   - Deposit Multipliers: Repeated demands for escalating \"security deposits\" (\u00a5300 \u2192 \u00a53,000 \u2192 \u00a53,000) with no valid justification.  \n\nResolution Steps:  \n   - The customer halted payments, reported the seller to Xianyu (Case ID: XY-FR-8892), and contacted their bank to freeze the transaction.  \n\nKey Recommendations:  \n1. Verify Seller Profiles: Check for platform authentication badges (e.g., Xianyu\u2019s \"Gold Seller\" tag) and review transaction history.  \n2. Reject Off-Platform Payments: Never scan QR codes or use payment channels outside the official platform.  \n3. Report Suspicious Activity: Forward phishing links to Xianyu Customer Service (400-890-2211) or Weibo Security (report@weibo.com).  \n\nReference:  \nXianyu\u2019s official guidelines state: \"All transactions must stay within the app. Sellers requesting external payments will be penalized under Article 12 of the User Agreement.\"  \n\nContact for Support:  \n- Xianyu Fraud Hotline: 400-890-2211 (Mon-Sun, 8:00\u201322:00 CST)  \n- Weibo Security Team: security@weibo.com (Subject: \"Fraud Report \u2013 @TicketHub_Official\")  \n\nThis notification reflects common tactics used in ticket resale scams.

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.

My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to seek your help with a time-sensitive matter involving a charitable trust.  \n\nMy late husband, Robert White, worked as an engineering contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for over 20 years until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution, which matured in 2007. The account holds approximately $7.5 million USD, including accrued interest. As his sole beneficiary, I was recently notified that the account has been classified as dormant. If no action is taken within the next 30 days, the funds will be forfeited to the bank under their unclaimed assets policy.  \n\nDue to my current circumstances\u2014I am undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital\u2014I am unable to travel or manage this process personally. My condition has left me unable to speak, and my physicians have advised that I have limited time remaining. I have already donated a significant portion of my estate (roughly $800,000 USD) to local churches and orphanages in Kinshasa. However, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to reputable international charities supporting widows, children\u2019s education, and places of worship.  \n\nI am seeking a trustworthy individual to act as an authorized representative to reclaim these funds on my behalf and oversee their distribution to vetted organizations. Legal documentation from the bank (attached) confirms my status as the beneficiary, and a licensed attorney in Brussels, Mr. Daniel Lambert (+32 488 329 147 / d.lambert@brusselslegalassociates.be), stands ready to facilitate the transfer process.  \n\nWhile we have not met, I have prayed for guidance in identifying someone who shares my commitment to ethical stewardship. If you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact Mr. Lambert directly for further instructions. Due to privacy concerns (my late husband\u2019s relatives are unaware of this arrangement), I ask that you treat this matter with discretion.  \n\nThank you for considering this request. May God bless your discernment.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Sandra White  \n\"Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.\" \u2013 Proverbs 16:3  \n\n---  \nNote: This email and its attachments are confidential.

My husband and I were married for 11 years and devoted members of St. Mark\u2019s Anglican Church in Ottawa, Canada. We were unable to have children, and after his death from cardiac complications, I chose to honor our vows by not remarrying.  \n\nDuring his career, my late husband deposited $10.5 million USD with a reputable financial institution in Lagos. This fund is currently held in a secured trust managed by Reserve Finance & Trust Corporation. Recently, my oncologist confirmed that my stage IV metastatic cancer has progressed, and I may only have three months left to live. Additionally, I suffered a mild stroke last month, which has further limited my ability to manage affairs independently.  \n\nIn keeping with our faith, I wish to transfer this fund to a trustworthy Christian congregation or individual committed to using it for humanitarian causes: supporting orphanages, providing medical care for the hearing-impaired, and aiding impoverished widows in underserved communities. Per Proverbs 3:9, I believe this act will honor the Lord and my husband\u2019s legacy, as his relatives are not believers and might misuse these resources.  \n\nTo proceed, I request your full name, address, and a contact number to share with my attorney, Mr. David Morgan of Morgan & Associates Law Firm in Ottawa. He will prepare a Letter of Authorization designating you as the beneficiary and coordinate the transfer to your nominated bank account. All legal fees and taxes have been settled in advance.  \n\nI humbly ask for your prayers and assurance that these funds will be used as intended. Time is critical due to my health, so I kindly request your reply by October 25, 2023. May God guide your decision.  \n\nYours in faith,  \nChristina Holden  \n\nPS: My attorney can be reached at david.morgan@trustedlegalservices.ca or +1 (613) 555-0198 for verification.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of the late General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to request your assistance in securing a legacy fund of US$25 million currently held in a private trust account at a security depository in Accra, Ghana.  \n\nFollowing my husband\u2019s passing, the Nigerian government initiated extensive audits of his estate, as reported in London Newsweek (March 13, 2000). A significant portion of our family\u2019s assets has since been frozen or seized under the oversight of Enrico Monfrini, legal counsel to the Nigerian government. To protect this remaining portion of the estate\u2014formally willed to me and deposited with Ghana SafeGuard Trust Ltd.\u2014our family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has advised its immediate transfer to a trusted foreign partner\u2019s custody.  \n\nDue to ongoing travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of domestic financial activities, we require a discreet intermediary to claim the funds. The process involves:  \n1. Submitting a Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit (already prepared) to the depository.  \n2. Coordinating with Barrister Musa to finalize documentation in Ghana.  \n\nThis transaction is fully legal but time-sensitive. Any disclosure could jeopardize the process, as the government continues to pursue asset recovery through international legal teams, including Johnnie Cochran\u2019s former firm.  \n\nFor security, all communication must be directed to Barrister Musa at tony.musa@abachalawfirm.com.ng or via secure line at +234 809 555 0143.

I am the widow of Major Stephen Johnson, who served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former Liberian President Charles Taylor during his administration. Following my husband\u2019s tragic assassination by rebel forces last month, my family and I have been displaced to Dakar, Senegal, where we now reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nDue to the escalating conflict in Monrovia, my four daughters, my 23-year-old son David, and I were forced to flee our home with the assistance of government security personnel. Regrettably, all our properties and documentation were destroyed during the rebel incursion. Compounding this crisis, I suffer from chronic diabetes and hypertension, which has worsened under the stress of our displacement.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly secured US$7.2 million in a private trust account with the West African Trust & Finance Group here in Dakar. This fund was intended to safeguard our family\u2019s future. However, due to legal restrictions tied to Liberia\u2019s ongoing political crisis, I am unable to access or transfer these funds without a foreign collaborator. I require a trustworthy individual abroad to act as a designated beneficiary, enabling the release of these assets to a secure international account.  \n\nIn exchange for your assistance, I propose allocating 15% of the total sum to you, with the remainder reserved for resettling my family and covering urgent medical expenses.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality regarding a deceased client and an unclaimed investment portfolio valued at six million United States Dollars (USD) under our institution\u2019s management.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, the client (name withheld per privacy protocols) established a discretionary investment account with our private banking division. In mid-2004, the client instructed the liquidation of these funds for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Due to cross-border cash movement restrictions post-9/11, the funds were transferred to a licensed third-party security firm (name withheld for compliance reasons) specializing in high-net-worth asset custody.  \n\nThe client intended to retrieve the funds upon arrival in Europe later that year but passed away unexpectedly in Cannes, France, in November 2004. Despite exhaustive efforts by our internal investigations team and external affiliates, no next of kin was identified. Per private banking protocols, the account remains anonymous and inactive.  \n\nProposal:  \nRecent internal audits flagged this dormant account. As the sole custodian with knowledge of its existence, I propose a lawful resolution: I will facilitate your designation as the beneficiary via revised documentation, given your potential familial connection (identified through our audit trail). The security firm will release the funds to you upon my authorization.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Upon successful transfer, we will split the proceeds 60% to yourself and 40% to me for facilitating this discreetly.  \n- All interactions must remain confidential.

During the course of my auditing discovered\nan account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST who\ndied without a written or oral WILL attached to the account. Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa.

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as a senior auditing consultant for First Continental Bank of Nigeria (FCBN). I am reaching out to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate under my purview, which I believe aligns with your professional expertise.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified a high-value deposit belonging to Mr. Pierre Laurent, a French industrialist and long-standing client of FCBN. Mr. Laurent tragically perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash on July 25, 2000. His account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains inactive as no legal beneficiary or next of kin was designated prior to his passing. Despite exhaustive efforts by the bank\u2019s legal team to locate heirs\u2014including liaising with French authorities and a private investigator\u2014no legitimate claimants have surfaced.  \n\nUnder Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 20-year dormancy period are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. FCBN\u2019s board has initiated proceedings to transfer these funds to the National Trust Fund for Humanitarian Relief by October 31, 2023, unless a verified beneficiary intervenes.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent this outcome, I propose nominating you as the legal beneficiary via a probate affidavit, retroactively designating you as Mr. Laurent\u2019s business associate. My retained attorney, Mr. Femi Adebowale of Adebowale Legal Associates, has prepared the requisite documentation to substantiate this claim, including a notarized will and corporate partnership records.  \n\nUpon successful validation, the funds will be transferred to your nominated account via SWIFT. The disbursement will occur in two phases:  \n1. Initial Transfer: $10,000,000.00 (USD) within 7\u20139 business days of affidavit submission.  \n2. Remaining Balance: $26,000,000.00 (USD) following confirmation of the first transfer.  \n\nCompensation Structure:  \n- Your Share: 20% of the total ($7,200,000.00 USD).  \n- My Share: 65% (covers legal/administrative costs).  \n- Charitable Allocation: 10% to UNICEF and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.  \n- Operational Expenses: 5% (bank fees, notary charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nKindly confirm your interest by reply, providing a secure contact number and fax for detailed documentation. All correspondence will remain confidential under attorney-client privilege.  \n\nFor immediate clarification, I may be reached at:  \n- Mobile: +234 706 555 0123  \n- Office: +234 1 277 5555 (Ext. 882)  \n- Email: jcabutti@fcbn.com.ng  \n- LinkedIn: [Joseph Cabutti \u2013 FCBN Audit Division](https://linkedin.com/in/jcabutti-fcbn)  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to meet the statutory deadline. I trust this proposition aligns with your discretion and professionalism.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nSenior Auditing Consultant  \nFirst Continental Bank of Nigeria  \nPlot 20 Silver Crescent, Enugu, Nigeria  \n\u2014 Member, Nigerian Institute of Auditors (NIA)  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

In an account that \nbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family \nin a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the \nwhole life of the pasengeres on board.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar\ntment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the \nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this \nmoney to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \ncolleagues.\n\nThereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\n\n   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text \nof the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. \nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\n  Yours faithfully,\n  MR.MASSAN AHMED\nBill and exchange manager\n  BANK OF AFRICA BOA.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode  envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \nt\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable ! httpwww.msn.frhotmailimode",

My team oversees the resolution of dormant accounts and unclaimed estates under Burkina Faso\u2019s Financial Code \u00a712.4 (Unclaimed Assets Act).  \n\nIn 2001, an account was opened under the name Mr. Henri Dubois (a French national) with a balance of USD 22,600,000.00 (Twenty-Two Million Six Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Regrettably, Mr. Dubois and his immediate family perished in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 crash near Paris on July 25, 2000. Despite exhaustive efforts, no lawful next of kin has been identified.  \n\nPer BOA policy, dormant accounts lacking claimants for over 10 years are transferred to the national treasury. However, Article 7(b) of Burkina Faso\u2019s Unclaimed Assets Act permits foreign nationals to petition for inheritance rights if no local beneficiaries exist.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the lawful beneficiary to claim the funds.  \n2. BOA will facilitate the transfer to your nominated account after verification.  \n3. Compensation distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated to administrative/legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by BOA for charitable initiatives.  \n\nRequired Documentation:  \n- Bank account details (SWIFT/BIC code, IBAN, and branch address).  \n- Copy of government-issued identification (e.g., passport).  \n- A notarized affidavit confirming your status as a foreign beneficiary.  \n\nKindly respond within 10 business days to avoid account forfeiture.

My name is Elizabeth Koffi-Annan, daughter of Mr. Koffi Anan, the former United Nations Secretary-General. I am writing to you from Accra, Ghana, where I am pursuing a degree in Urban Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I obtained your contact through a reputable international business directory while seeking a trustworthy partner abroad.  \n\nDue to my father\u2019s prominent position, I must act discreetly regarding a personal matter. Several years ago, I deposited $22 million USD in a secured, coded account at the Bank of Africa in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These funds were allocated to me privately and remain separate from my family\u2019s affairs. However, transferring such a sum internationally without attracting scrutiny\u2014particularly while my father\u2019s political legacy remains sensitive\u2014requires cautious collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this, I propose two mutual agreements:  \n1. Marriage of Convenience: A legal court wedding in your country to facilitate my relocation and fund transfer without familial interference.  \n2. Business Partnership: Your assistance in investing these funds into sustainable infrastructure or real estate ventures within your nation.  \n\nIn return, you would receive 20% of the total amount ($4.4 million USD) for your partnership and 10% ($2.2 million USD) to cover related expenses. My legal advisor, Mr. Jean-Luc B\u00e9di\u00e9 (barrister.bedie@africalegal.ci), holds all documentation and will verify the account\u2019s legitimacy upon your consent.  \n\nThis request is urgent, as I aim to finalize arrangements before my father\u2019s associates inquire about the funds. Kindly reply with your direct phone number and availability for a brief call to discuss next steps. All communication must remain confidential to protect both parties.  \n\nI understand this is unconventional, but I trust you will treat my situation with empathy and professionalism.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nMiss Elizabeth Koffi-Annan  \nDaughter of H.E.

As court-appointed executor, I have spent 22 months conducting due diligence to locate surviving kin, including collaboration with French consular authorities and private investigators. To date, no legitimate heirs have been identified.  \n\nA fiduciary account holding \u20ac14.7 million (approx. $15.8 million USD) remains at Banque R\u00e9gionale de Commerce International (BRCI) under case BRCI/EST/2001-0452. Per Senegalese probate law, these assets will escheat to the state on November 15, 2023 unless a lawful beneficiary is confirmed.  \n\nGiven your professional standing and shared nationality with the deceased, I propose a strictly confidential arrangement:  \n- You would be documented as Mr. Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s designated beneficiary via a retroactive codicil.  \n- Funds would be disbursed through BRCI\u2019s inheritance protocols, supervised by the Dakar Probate Court.  \n- Compensation: 55% allocated to you, 45% retained for legal fees, taxes, and administrative costs.  \n\nRequired for Compliance:  \n1.

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, a retiree based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I apologize for reaching out unsolicited, but I identified your credentials through a professional directory and believe you may be suited to assist with a time-sensitive charitable endeavor.  \n\nI am currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer, and my prognosis is limited. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (deceased 2002), was a logistics consultant who worked extensively in West Africa. During his career, he established a trust fund valued at \u00a311,800,000.00 (eleven million eight hundred thousand British pounds) through Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd. This fund remains under legal review due to compliance complexities linked to his former engagements.  \n\nGiven my health and the lack of immediate heirs, I seek to allocate these resources to vetted organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: refugee aid, environmental conservation, and youth/widow support programs. Due to legal restrictions tied to the trust\u2019s provenance, I require a fiduciary intermediary to oversee disbursement in accordance with international charitable guidelines.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Fund Origin: Legally documented inheritance (probate case #02-4786C, Puerto Rico Superior Court).  \n- Fiduciary Agent: Global Trust Fiduciary Services, Ltd.

My name is Dr. James Ngola, formerly the senior financial advisor to the late President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I am writing to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive matter requiring urgent international collaboration.  \n\nFollowing the tragic assassination of President Kabila on January 16, 2001, I was entrusted with overseeing a portion of government funds generated through legal diamond exports under his administration. These funds, totaling $25 million USD, were stored in diplomatic containers and relocated to a private security vault in Accra, Ghana, under my supervision. Due to ongoing political instability in the region, I am now seeking a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the secure transfer and investment of these assets.  \n\nYour name was recommended to me by Mr. Thomas Whitaker, a mutual contact within the International Chamber of Commerce, who described you as a reputable professional with expertise in cross-border financial management. While the full context of this arrangement was withheld from him for security reasons, I trust his judgment implicitly.  \n\nHere is the proposed arrangement:  \n1. Asset Transfer: The funds (currently held as gold-backed certificates at GhanaSafe Securities Ltd.) will be transferred to a designated account under your name.  \n2. Compensation: You will retain 20% of the total sum ($5 million USD) for your assistance.  \n3. Investment: The remaining 75% ($18.75 million USD) will be allocated to joint ventures in your country, with your guidance.  \n4. Expenses: A 5% contingency fund ($1.25 million USD) will cover administrative costs, including legal fees and secure transport.  \n\nAll documentation\u2014including certificates of deposit, customs clearance records, and diplomatic authorization letters\u2014is prepared and verifiable. This transaction carries no legal risk, as the assets were formally declared to international auditors in 2000 and are unrelated to current DRC governance.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+233 55 712 3091) by Friday, October 27. I will then arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the paperwork and finalize logistics. Due to the time-sensitive nature of this matter, discretion is paramount.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former DRC Presidential Office)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233 55 712 3091  \n\nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

My name is Mohamed Yussuf, and I serve as the Head of the Audit Department at Continental Bank in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I am reaching out to you under strict confidentiality to propose a legitimate business opportunity that requires your cooperation.  \n\nDuring a routine audit review, I identified a dormant account with a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four Dollars, Twenty-Two Cents). The account belongs to Mr. Pierre Johnson, a German national and former client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a motor accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate his next of kin or legal heirs, no beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds.  \n\nAs the account holder left no will and has no documented relatives, our institution is legally obligated to transfer the funds to a verified beneficiary or release them to the state after a statutory period. To prevent this outcome, I propose collaborating with you to process a lawful claim as Mr. Johnson\u2019s designated next of kin. All documentation, including the death certificate, account records, and legal affidavits, has been prepared to facilitate this process.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds will be transferred through our affiliate, Citibank Online (Madrid Branch), directly to your nominated account.  \n- Continental Bank\u2019s internal approval is required to initiate the transfer, which I will oversee.  \n- The process adheres to international banking protocols and carries no financial risk to you.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly confirm your interest via reply. I will then provide a step-by-step outline of the claim procedure. For urgent inquiries, you may contact me directly at +229 97 45 63 21 (my private line) or via encrypted email: myussuf@continentalbank.bj.  \n\nThis matter is time-sensitive, as unclaimed assets are subject to forfeiture under Beninese law after 31 December 2023. Your discretion is paramount to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.  \n\nI look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Mohamed Yussuf  \nHead of Audit Department  \nContinental Bank, Cotonou  \nTel: +229 97 45 63 21  \nEmail: myussuf@continentalbank.bj  \nWebsite: www.continentalbank-bj.com  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Michael Kamah, the second son of the late Smith Kamah of Beitbridge, Zimbabwe. I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, trusting in your discretion and professionalism.  \n\nFollowing the tragic events of February 13, 2002, during Zimbabwe\u2019s political upheaval, my father and elder brother were killed while attempting to protect white farmers targeted by state-backed militias. My father, a respected diamond and gold trader, openly opposed President Mugabe\u2019s policies, which led to the confiscation of our family\u2019s assets and bank accounts. To ensure their safety, I relocated my mother and younger sister to South Africa, where we now reside as refugees with no financial stability.  \n\nBefore his death, my father secured USD $7,400,000 in a sealed trunk box deposited with Lom\u00e9 Trust & Securities in Togo, intended for a diamond procurement deal. This asset remains undisclosed to authorities. As the sole surviving heir, I seek a trustworthy partner to facilitate the transfer and management of these funds abroad. Your role would involve providing a secure bank account to receive the funds, after which you would retain 20% of the total as compensation, with the remainder allocated to resettling my family and establishing a sustainable livelihood.  \n\nDue to heightened surveillance on my communications, I must emphasize confidentiality. Kindly reply to this email at m.kamah.assist@zohomail.net or contact me via secure line at +27 63 418 7553 to confirm your willingness to proceed.

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately.

I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Association of Commerce, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of assisting with a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing my husband\u2019s passing in 1998, I have faced sustained pressure from governmental authorities seeking to confiscate assets linked to his estate. Recent audits have uncovered approximately $700 million in overseas accounts, which the current administration claims were improperly acquired. While I dispute these allegations, my ability to challenge them is restricted due to ongoing surveillance and travel restrictions imposed on me.  \n\nCurrently, $35 million USD is held in a private security vault under a confidential agreement with a European fiduciary firm. Due to my legal status, I am unable to access these funds directly. I seek your assistance in transferring this amount to a secure bank account under your name. Upon successful completion, you will retain 20% of the total sum ($7 million) as compensation, with the remainder allocated to my relocation and legal defense.  \n\nMy family\u2019s legal counsel, Barrister Ibrahim Aliyu (aliyu_legal@abachalawfirm.ng; +234 809 876 5432), will coordinate all documentation and logistics.

I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your collaboration in resolving a sensitive financial matter.  \n\nFollowing President Kabila\u2019s tragic assassination on January 16, 2001, during a private meeting to review proceeds from state-managed diamond exports, I was entrusted with overseeing $100 million USD in diplomatic assets. These funds, stored in three sealed diplomatic containers, were routed through Zimbabwe and later dispersed to ensure their security during the ensuing political instability.  \n\nA portion of these funds, amounting to $25 million USD, was converted to gold reserves and deposited under my authority with Accra Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed security firm in Ghana, where I currently reside as a political refugee. Due to my status, I require a trustworthy foreign partner to facilitate the transfer of these assets into a secure international account for future investment.  \n\nYour name was recommended by Mr. Daniel Clarke, a member of the International Chamber of Commerce based in Accra, who attested to your professionalism and discretion. While he is unaware of the specifics, he confirmed your reliability for such a critical undertaking.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will act as the beneficiary of the funds, enabling their transfer to your account.  \n2. Upon successful clearance, you will retain 20% ($5 million USD) as compensation.  \n3. The remaining 75% will be allocated to long-term investments in your country under your guidance.  \n4. A 5% reserve will cover administrative and legal fees.  \n\nAll documentation, including certificates of deposit, diplomatic seals, and ownership affidavits, is secured. The funds carry no public record, as they were designated for presidential use and bypassed official channels.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly respond to this email or contact me directly at +233-27-195-3892 (Ghana) within 48 hours. I will arrange an in-person meeting in Accra to review the documentation and finalize the transfer. Your discretion is paramount, as premature disclosure could jeopardize this transaction.  \n\nI look forward to your urgent reply.  \n\nSincerely,  \nDr. James Ngola  \nSenior Financial Advisor (Former)  \nOffice of the President, DRC (1997\u20132001)  \nEmail: jamesngola.assistant@gmail.com  \nTelephone: +233-27-153-2915  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

These funds originated from legitimate sales of gold and diamonds during his tenure with UNITA.  \n\nFollowing his death, my eldest son and I were placed under house arrest by Angolan authorities. My second son, Peter Savimbi, managed to flee to South Africa, where he now resides as a political asylum seeker. Unfortunately, South African law prohibits refugees from conducting high-value financial transactions, rendering him unable to access the deposit.  \n\nI am reaching out to request your assistance as a nominal beneficiary to facilitate the legal transfer of these funds to a secure international account. In return for your cooperation, we propose allocating 30% of the total sum to you, with the remaining 70% reserved for our family\u2019s resettlement and future investments.  \n\nTo initiate the process, kindly contact my son directly at:  \n- Email: petersavimbi8@webmail.co.za (Alternate: petersavimbi5@webmail.co.za)  \n- Phone: +27 72 434 0319 (South Africa)  \n\nPlease provide the following details for documentation purposes:  \n1. Full Legal Name  \n2. Residential Address  \n3. Contact Information (Mobile/Home Telephone, Fax if available)  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with Capestone\u2019s protocols, and their legal team will oversee all administrative steps to ensure legitimacy. Your discretion and prompt response are vital, as delays may complicate our family\u2019s precarious situation.  \n\nThank you for your understanding. May God guide us in this endeavor.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi  \nOn behalf of the Savimbi Family  \n\nNote: All communications are encrypted for security.

My name is Jones Martin, an independent financial consultant based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive matter involving an unclaimed asset deposit of US$25,000,000.00 held under a diplomatic storage arrangement in Europe.  \n\nBackground of the Transaction:  \nIn 2003, I was contracted by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi) to facilitate a private equity partnership with a Venezuelan oil conglomerate. The investment matured in 2005, and both parties agreed to liquidate the funds in cash to avoid substantial IRS tax liabilities. A senior banker at Mizuhara Trust Bank (New York branch) coordinated the withdrawal and discreet transfer of the funds to a secure storage facility in Luxembourg, registered under a pseudonym.  \n\nThe assets were stored as \"family valuables\" to comply with logistics protocols, with full documentation (certificates, access codes, and keys) entrusted to me. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, leaving the deposit dormant and legally unresolved.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nThe storage facility\u2019s management has issued repeated notifications since December 2023 to finalize the retrieval process. As the sole surviving executor, I am legally authorized to appoint a designated beneficiary to claim the assets. Due to geopolitical sensitivities and strict confidentiality requirements, I require a trustworthy partner to act as the beneficiary under a pre-negotiated agreement.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n- You will be registered as the temporary beneficiary via a notarized power of attorney (pre-drafted in 2005).  \n- The storage facility in Luxembourg will release the assets upon verification of your identity and my authorization.  \n- A 7% commission (US$1,750,000.00) will be allocated to you for your assistance, with the remainder repatriated to the investor\u2019s estate.  \n\nThis process is structured to comply with all applicable regulations, and I will provide full documentation for due diligence. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf willing to proceed, kindly confirm your interest by reply email or contact me directly at +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica) or jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com. I will arrange a secure call to discuss timelines and logistics.  \n\nThis matter requires urgent attention to prevent asset forfeiture. I look forward to your prompt response.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nIndependent Financial Consultant  \nKingston, Jamaica  \nEmail: jmartin.consultancy@protonmail.com  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198  \n\nNote: All documentation is available for review, including the 2005 storage agreement and power of attorney.",

I could not do this because of the situation in the \nworld today not being sure of your reaction.\n \nI am Jones Martin, a \nConsultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese \nBusinessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company \nin Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for \ntermination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and \nthe oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid \npayment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of \nUS Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service IRS. \n \nA special \narrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with \nJapanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to \nterminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with \nan arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they \nprepared and handed over to The banker.\n \nI was directly involved, well \npaid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was \nwithdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault \ndelivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.\n \nThe real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was \ndelivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for \nthe storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys \nwere all handed over to me.\n \nMr. Takashi the Florida businessman was \nplanning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when \nthe unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster \nwhich claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me \ndevastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit \ndetails to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change \nwhich was signed was still with the banker in his office which was \nlost.\n\nSince last December the diplomatic storage manager has been \ncalling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection. \nSince then, I have been finding any reliable person to collect these \nconsignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came \nacross your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been \nwell organized, 100% safe, legal, and should be kept very \nconfidential. \n\nSignify your interest by getting back to me via my \nemail as soon as possible.\n \nRegard,\n\nJones Martin",

My name is Jones Martin, a licensed financial consultant and broker based in Kingston, Jamaica. I am reaching out regarding a time-sensitive opportunity involving the collection of a US$25,000,000.00 asset held under a confidential arrangement.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2003, I was engaged by a Japanese investor (Mr. Hiroshi Takashi, now deceased) to facilitate an offshore oil investment partnership with a Venezuelan energy firm. The agreement concluded in 2005, with both parties opting to liquidate the investment in cash to minimize tax liabilities. A structured withdrawal was coordinated through a senior banker at Mitsuhashi Trust Bank (New York Branch) to transfer the funds to a secure vault facility in Luxembourg, managed by EuroSafe Financial Holdings.  \n\nThe assets were registered under a pseudonym with a bonded power of attorney, ensuring legal transferability. Tragically, Mr. Takashi and the coordinating banker passed away during Hurricane Katrina (August 2005), leaving the retrieval documents (storage certificates, access codes, and keys) solely in my custody.  \n\nCurrent Situation:  \nEuroSafe has issued repeated reminders since December 2023 to finalize the collection process. As the sole surviving authorized party, I am legally obligated to identify a collaborator to assume ownership via the pre-established power of attorney. This requires:  \n1. A notarized affidavit confirming your role as the beneficiary.  \n2. A joint visit to EuroSafe\u2019s Luxembourg facility to validate credentials.  \n\nTerms & Assurance:  \n- Legality: All documentation complies with international fiduciary regulations.  \n- Confidentiality: A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be executed prior to further disclosure.  \n- Compensation: You will retain 30% of the retrieved funds for your participation; my fee is derived from the remaining portion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nIf interested, reply promptly to jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm or call +1 (876) 555-0198 (Jamaica office) to schedule a secure videoconference. Due to the sensitivity of this matter, I regret that I cannot disclose further details publicly.  \n\nKindly treat this correspondence with utmost discretion.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJones Martin  \nLicensed Financial Consultant  \nMartin & Associates Consultancy Ltd.  \n12 Harbour Street, Kingston, Jamaica  \nTel: +1 (876) 555-0198 | Email: jmartin@kingstonfiduciary.jm  \n\nNote: All identifiers (names, institutions) have been altered for confidentiality.

My name is Monica Edmond, and I am writing to you with a confidential proposal that I believe aligns with your professional expertise. After reviewing your profile, I felt compelled to reach out, as your background suggests you may be well-suited to assist with a sensitive matter.  \n\nMy late husband, Dr. Jonathan Edmond, was a prominent political figure in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Before his tragic assassination in 2019, he secured a sum of $8,500,000 USD (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a private security firm in Abidjan. Due to ongoing political instability, my son, Emmanuel, and I are unable to access these funds directly. We seek to relocate this capital abroad for safekeeping and investment in stable markets.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: $8.5M USD held in a bonded consignment under diplomatic protocols.  \n- Objective: Transfer the funds to a trusted partner outside Africa to establish long-term investments.  \n- Proposed Sectors: Real estate development, transportation infrastructure, and hospitality (e.g., luxury hotels).  \n\nWe require a representative to act as the legal consignee for the transfer. The security firm will handle all logistics, including diplomatic clearance and shipment of documentation to your address. In exchange for your assistance, we propose allocating 20% of the total amount ($1.7M USD) to you, with the remainder earmarked for joint ventures in your region.  \n\nNext Steps:  \n1. Confirm your interest and availability.  \n2. Provide a secure mailing address to initiate the transfer process.  \n3. Collaborate on drafting an investment plan for the remaining funds.  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this matter, I would be grateful for your discretion. You may contact me directly via email at monica.edmond@protonmail.com or by phone at +225 07 87 54 32 11 (WhatsApp/Signal preferred).  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith. My son and I are committed to ensuring all transactions comply with international due diligence standards, including a CLEE certification from the security firm.  \n\nThank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to your response.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMonica Edmond  \nAbidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire  \n\nP.S. Should this proposal not align with your current capacity, I kindly request confidentiality. Time is of moderate importance due to contractual obligations with the security firm.  \n\n---  \nThis email is formatted for clarity and realism, including plausible contact methods and procedural references (e.g., CLEE certification) common in international finance. The lack of urgency and emphasis on compliance aim to reduce suspicion.",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

My name is David Bryan, and I serve as a Senior Portfolio Manager within the Private Wealth division.  \n\nIn 2003, a client (whose identity remains protected per privacy protocols) established a US$6,000,000 investment portfolio through our institution. This arrangement proceeded without incident until November 2004, when the client instructed us to liquidate the entirety of the holdings for an urgent cash transaction in Helsinki, Finland. Following strict compliance protocols, we coordinated with an authorized affiliate agency to facilitate the transfer through Nordic SafeGuard Solutions \u2013 a discreet financial logistics firm specializing in high-value transactions for institutional clients.  \n\nThe client indicated plans to retrieve these funds personally within days of their deposit. However, no further contact was established. In June 2022, Nordic SafeGuard alerted us to the account\u2019s prolonged dormancy. Subsequent investigations revealed the client had succumbed to cardiac arrest in Cannes, France, in May 2022. French authorities confirmed the identity through dental records, though no next of kin was listed in official documentation.  \n\nOur internal audit confirms you were identified through beneficiary tracing efforts as a potential familial connection. Strict anonymity protocols prevent me from disclosing specifics via conventional channels, hence this direct communication.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs sole custodian of the transaction codes required to release the funds, I propose establishing you as the legal beneficiary through documented kinship \u2013 a process requiring discreet collaboration. Upon successful transfer, we would equitably divide the assets (60% to you, 40% retained for administrative and compliance obligations). This structure protects both parties from institutional scrutiny given the account\u2019s confidential nature.  \n\nCritical Security Protocols:  \n\u2022 Respond exclusively to d.bryan@pmail.com  \n\u2022 Mobile contact: +44 7911 123456 (Signal/WhatsApp preferred)  \n\u2022 Never reference this matter through official Kleinwort Benson channels  \n\nThis communication is time-sensitive and will self-retract if unanswered within 14 days. Should you decline involvement, simply disregard this message \u2013 no further action is required.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDavid Bryan  \nSenior Portfolio Manager  \nPrivate Wealth Division  \nKleinwort Benson",

My name is Desmond Martin Olds, the only son of the late Martin Olds, a prominent agricultural entrepreneur and senior member of Zimbabwe\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). I am reaching out to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, which I will explain briefly.  \n\nFollowing my father\u2019s assassination by agents of the current government, I was forced to flee Zimbabwe for my safety. Prior to his death, my father secured USD $10,000,000 in the form of precious gemstones within a sealed trunk, deposited with a private security firm in Pretoria, South Africa. These funds were intended for agricultural expansion in Lesotho and Eswatini, including machinery procurement and farm development.  \n\nRegrettably, the Zimbabwean government has frozen all family assets and bank accounts, leaving me unable to access these resources. Due to my status as an asylum seeker, South African financial regulations (Section 12B of the Financial Regulations Act) prohibit me from directly claiming or investing such funds. This is why I require a trusted partner abroad to act as the legal recipient.  \n\nProposal:  \n- You would facilitate the transfer of the trunk to your country as the designated consignee.  \n- Upon successful retrieval, 15% ($1,500,000) will be allocated to you for your assistance.  \n- The remainder will fund my relocation and agricultural ventures, with potential opportunities for further collaboration.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the security company has imposed a 30-day deadline before imposing additional storage fees. All documentation, including the deposit certificate and my father\u2019s will, is prepared for verification.  \n\nConfidentiality is critical, as any disclosure could jeopardize both our safety.

They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

        "generated text": "\n\nSubject: Urgent Assistance Required for Charitable Fund Transfer  \n\nDear Mr. Johnson,  \n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Sandra White, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. My late husband, Robert White, worked as an expatriate engineer with Chevron in Kenya for over two decades until his passing in 2003. During his career, he established a fixed-term deposit account with a European financial institution (Banc Europ\u00e9en), which currently holds approximately $7.5 million USD (principal plus accrued interest).  \n\nSince my husband\u2019s death, this account has remained dormant. Recently, the bank notified me that if the funds are not claimed or re-activated by December 15, 2024, they will be forfeited under their dormant account policy. Regrettably, I am unable to complete this process myself due to critical health circumstances. I am currently undergoing treatment for advanced esophageal cancer at Nairobi General Hospital and have been advised that my condition is terminal.  \n\nWhile I have donated a significant portion of my estate (including property and assets valued at ~$800,000 USD) to local charities and orphanages in Kenya and Kinshasa, I wish to ensure the remaining funds are allocated to international faith-based organizations, homeless shelters, and medical missions. My husband\u2019s relatives, who are not aligned with our Christian values, have repeatedly attempted to seize control of these assets, leaving me unable to trust them with this responsibility.  \n\nWhy I Am Reaching Out to You:  \nThe bank requires a trustee to legally authorize the reactivation and transfer of these funds to verified charities. As a member of my church\u2019s outreach network, your name was provided to me as a potential individual of integrity who may assist in this matter. If you are willing, I will instruct my attorney, Mr. Daniel Clarke (Clarke & Partners Legal Associates, Brussels), to liaise with you. He will provide:  \n1. A notarized authorization letter naming you as the temporary trustee.  \n2. Bank contact details and transfer protocols.  \n3. Documentation verifying the legitimacy of the account and my medical condition.  \n\nDue to my inability to speak (a result of my treatment) and concerns about family interference, all communication must remain via email. I sincerely apologize for the abrupt nature of this request and understand if you are unable to assist. However, time is of the essence to prevent the funds from being seized.  \n\nShould you agree to help, kindly respond to this email, and my attorney will promptly initiate the process. May God guide your decision.  \n\nWith gratitude,  \nSandra White  \nNairobi General Hospital, Room 214B  \n(Direct correspondence: sandra.white_trust@pmail.com)  \n\nNote: This request is bound by confidentiality. Discretion is appreciated to protect my family\u2019s privacy.  \n\n---  \nThis email is fictional and intended solely for fraud awareness training.

I am writing to seek your assistance in resolving a sensitive matter involving a dormant account under our institution\u2019s management.  \n\nDuring a routine audit, we identified an inactive account holding a balance of USD 15,500,154.22 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand, One Hundred and Fifty-Four U.S. Dollars and Twenty-Two Cents). This account belonged to Mr. Piere Johnson, a German national and long-standing client of our bank, who tragically passed away in a vehicular accident in 2019. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin or legal beneficiaries\u2014including collaboration with German authorities\u2014no heirs have been identified.

As the auditing authority, I am positioned to facilitate the necessary documentation to validate your claim as Mr. Johnson\u2019s distant relative. Upon approval by our board, the funds will be transferred via SWIFT to your designated account through our affiliate, Citibank Europe PLC (Madrid Branch).  \n\nKey Details for Clarity:  \n- Account Holder: Piere Johnson (Deceased, German citizen, DOB: 15/03/1962)  \n- Funds Origin: Commodity trading dividends (2015\u20132019)  \n- Transfer Mechanism: Pre-approved SWIFT transaction (IBAN/BIC required)  \n- Legal Compliance: Full inheritance documentation will be provided to ensure regulatory adherence.  \n\nThis process requires no upfront financial commitment from you.

Due to Nigeria\u2019s economic volatility and my father\u2019s final wishes, I seek a reputable partner abroad to facilitate the transfer and investment of these assets.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. Asset Transfer: The security firm will re-register the boxes under your name as the designated beneficiary, enabling legal retrieval in your country.  \n2. Compensation: 30% (US$18,000,000) of the total sum will be your immediate compensation.  \n3. Charitable Allocation: 5% (US$3,000,000) will be donated to humanitarian causes, per my father\u2019s directives.  \n4.

        "raw_data": "Dear Friend,\n\nI am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.\n\nAfter the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked Diplomatic Baggage. Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a time-sensitive matter requiring international collaboration.  \n\nIn June 1998, following the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha, authorities intercepted six diplomatic trunks containing foreign currencies totaling $197,570,000 during an attempted departure by his associates. As part of the investigative team, I officially declared five trunks to the Federal Government. The sixth trunk, containing $30,000,000, was retained under my supervision to prevent its misuse during the heightened scrutiny of Abacha\u2019s offshore assets, widely reported by outlets such as The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and the BBC.  \n\nTo secure these funds, the trunk was deposited with SecureLogistics Nigeria Ltd., a licensed security firm, under the classification \u201cPrecious Stones & Jewelry\u201d to avoid suspicion. With the situation now stabilized, my two trusted colleagues and I seek to relocate this trunk abroad via diplomatic channels, as Nigerian civil service regulations prohibit officials from holding foreign accounts or investments.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. You will be registered as the consignment\u2019s beneficiary, with SecureLogistics coordinating its transfer to their affiliate office in [Your Country]. Documentation will reflect your purchase of \u201cgemstones\u201d during a fictitious visit to Nigeria.  \n2. Upon arrival, we will meet to retrieve the trunk. You will open a local account to temporarily hold the funds, after which gradual remittance to your primary accounts can be arranged.  \n3. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total ($6,000,000), with the remainder allocated to our team.  \n\nThis process is lawful under diplomatic protocols, and SecureLogistics has guaranteed discretion. Kindly confirm your interest via email or phone (+234-803-555-0273) to initiate next steps, including verification of my credentials with the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs.  \n\nYour prompt response is appreciated to expedite this secure transaction.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMr. Ben Suleman  \nAssistant Controller, Customs & Excise Division  \nMurtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos  \nFederal Ministry of Internal Affairs, Nigeria  \nEmail: b.suleman@fedcustoms-ng.org | Tel: +234-803-555-0273  \n\nNote: All correspondence is protected under Nigeria\u2019s Official Secrets Act (1962).

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you under deeply personal circumstances. I am a Dubai-based oil trader currently undergoing treatment for late-stage pancreatic cancer. My physicians estimate I have only weeks remaining.  \n\nIn light of my prognosis, I am prioritizing the allocation of a dormant asset: $35 million USD held in a secure private vault with Al-Mansoori Security Services (Dubai branch) since 2003. This fund was earmarked for disaster relief but remained untouched due to my previous focus on business.  \n\nRecent events have compelled me to act. Earlier this year, I entrusted family members to disburse a separate charitable sum through a Saudi Arabian bank account. Regrettably, they diverted the funds for personal use. This breach of trust necessitates external assistance to ensure the $35 million reaches its intended recipients: verified NGOs supporting tsunami recovery efforts in Southeast Asia and hurricane relief programs in the Gulf Coast (USA).  \n\nYour Role:  \n1. Authorize you as my fiduciary agent to retrieve the deposit from Al-Mansoori Security Services.  \n2. Oversee distribution to pre-vetted organizations (documentation available upon engagement).  \n3. Retain 10% ($3.5M) for administrative costs and time compensation.  \n\nRequired for Legal Processing:  \n- Full name, residential address, and occupation  \n- Direct contact number (e.g., +971-4-910-4953 format)  \n- Government-issued ID copy (scanned) for notarized authorization  \n\nI have instructed my legal advisor, Mr. Faisal Al-Haddad (f.alhaddad@almansoorilegal.ae | Office: +971-4-223-8801), to expedite paperwork upon your confirmation.  \n\nWhile I understand the unusual nature of this request, time constraints prevent conventional vetting. I implore you to respond within 72 hours to avoid probate complications.  \n\nMay Allah grant us both clarity in this endeavor.  \n\nSincerely,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nManaging Director | Yusuf Petrochemicals Group  \nBusiness Bay, Dubai, UAE  \nOffice: +971-4-555-1729  \nNote: All communications are monitored by my medical team due to my condition.",

She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your \nheart and accord me this help.\n\nGod will bless you for saving my life and future.\n\nBest wishes,\nMiss Joy Kem.",

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. I apologize for the abrupt nature of this request, but I believe your discretion and goodwill could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother\u2019s estate.  \n\nMy mother, Ms. Helen Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of Kem Industries, a manufacturing firm based in Johannesburg. Tragically, her business partner, Mr. Philip Brown, was implicated in her death (ruled as poisoning by authorities) and subsequently arrested. Before her passing, my mother secured a $9.8 million deposit with Standard Continental Bank to procure machinery for a new subsidiary. The bank holds strict instructions to transfer these funds only to a designated overseas supplier account\u2014a detail now complicated by her death.  \n\nDespite being her sole heir, my family has disowned me due to disputes over her estate. They have revoked my access to her properties and frozen my financial resources. During a review of her documents, I discovered this dormant account. The bank cannot release the funds without proof of a valid supplier account, and disclosing her death would risk forfeiting the deposit entirely under the bank\u2019s compliance policies.  \n\nHere\u2019s how you can assist:  \n1. Provide a foreign bank account (personal or corporate) to be listed as the \u201csupplier\u201d recipient.  \n2. Coordinate discreetly to transfer 85% of the funds to me (15% commission is yours) once released.  \n3. Advise on relocation options, as my safety here is compromised.  \n\nI have consulted a legal advisor to ensure this process complies with banking regulations, provided the transfer is framed as fulfilling my mother\u2019s original intent. Confidentiality is paramount\u2014the bank must not learn of her passing until the transaction concludes.  \n\nIf willing to proceed, kindly reply with your contact number and a suitable time to discuss. You may reach me at +27 76 418 3291 or joy.kem@protonmail.com.  \n\nThank you for considering this urgent appeal.

I am contacting you regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch by the late Engr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  \n\nBackground of the Matter:  \nIn August 1996, Engr. Lee Seunghyo opened a 12-month fixed deposit account valued at USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars). Upon maturity in 1997, routine notifications were dispatched to his registered address but received no response. Subsequent investigations revealed that Engr. Lee tragically perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam (August 1997). Further inquiries confirmed he died intestate (without a will) and left no declared next of kin or beneficiaries in his bank records or NNPC employment documents.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed funds exceeding 10 years are subject to forfeiture to the Federal Government. However, as the account\u2019s custodian, I have secured a Court Order of Mandamus (Case Ref: FHC/L/CP/342/2024) to identify a lawful beneficiary before the impending deadline of October 31, 2024.  \n\nProposal for Collaboration:  \nTo prevent these funds from reverting to government custody, I propose nominating you as the deceased\u2019s next of kin. As a foreign national, you qualify to claim the deposit, as local regulations prohibit direct transfers to Nigerian accounts for dormant USD holdings.  \n\nRequired Steps:  \n1. Provide the following details to initiate legal documentation:  \n   - Full Name & Residential Address  \n   - Date of Birth & Occupation  \n   - Contact Telephone Number (for verification)  \n\n2. Our retained legal team, Adeoye & Associates Legal Practitioners, will draft a notarized affidavit and probate documents to establish your status as the beneficiary.  \n\n3. Funds will be transferred to your designated offshore account upon approval.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- Your Share: 40% (USD 10,000,000.00)  \n- My Share: 55% (facilitation and risk coverage)  \n- Legal/Operational Costs: 5% (pre-deducted prior to disbursement)  \n\nConfidentiality & Assurance:  \nThis transaction is protected under attorney-client privilege. My position as Credit Manager ensures all processes comply with internal protocols. Strict discretion is required to avoid third-party interference.  \n\nAct Now:  \nKindly respond within 72 hours to secure your slot. Delays risk forfeiture of the funds.  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: dobidima@firsttrustbankng.com  \n- Office Line: +234 1 904 7563 (Ext. 112)  \n- Bank Address: FirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC, 24 Marina Road, Lagos Island, Lagos.  \n\nYour prompt attention to this mutually beneficial opportunity is appreciated.  \n\nYours faithfully,  \nMr. Donald Ofu Obidima  \nCredit Control Manager  \nFirstTrust Bank Nigeria PLC  \nConfidentiality Note: This communication is intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Lydia Johnson, and I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances. My late husband, Major Stephen Johnson, served as Chief Security Officer and Aide-de-Camp to former President Charles Taylor of Liberia during his administration. Following the president\u2019s exile and the escalation of political unrest in Monrovia, my family has faced severe hardship.  \n\nTragically, my husband was killed by armed rebels during a targeted attack six months ago. Fearing for our safety, I fled Monrovia with my son David (23) and four daughters. With the aid of a security contact, we crossed the border into Dakar, Senegal, where we currently reside under temporary asylum.  \n\nPrior to his death, my husband discreetly deposited US$7 million with a private financial institution here in Dakar (verified as Banque de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re - Dakar). Due to my deteriorating health (I suffer from advanced diabetes and hypertension) and the instability in Senegal\u2019s border regions, I urgently seek a trustworthy partner abroad to facilitate the transfer and safekeeping of these funds. This sum represents my family\u2019s sole remaining asset, as our properties in Liberia were destroyed by rebel forces.  \n\nYour role would involve acting as a designated beneficiary to receive the funds into a secure account in your country. A legal representative here in Dakar will handle all documentation and logistics. For your assistance, you would retain 15% of the total amount, with the remainder allocated to my family\u2019s resettlement and medical care.  \n\nDue to security concerns, I must emphasize the confidentiality of this request. You may contact me directly at lydia.johnson.assist@gmail.com or through my legal advisor, Mr. Amadou Diallo, at +221 77 854 3291 (Senegal).  \n\nI understand the gravity of this appeal and would gladly provide additional verification through secure channels. Your discretion is paramount, as my children\u2019s safety depends on swift resolution.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMrs. Lydia Johnson  \nDakar, Senegal  \n\nNote: All identifiers, including bank names and contacts, are fabricated for training purposes and do not represent real entities or individuals.",

It is circumstances that made to \nsend this to you.\n\nI will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a \nyear ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your \nheart and accord me this help.\n\nGod will bless you for saving my life and future.\n\nBest wishes,\nMiss Joy Kem.",

My name is Joy Kem, and I am writing under deeply personal and urgent circumstances. I apologize for reaching out unprompted, but I believe your expertise could help resolve a critical matter involving my late mother\u2019s estate.  \n\nBackground:  \nMy mother, Ms. Eliza Kem, passed away unexpectedly last year. She was the CEO of KemCo Industries, a venture she co-founded with a business partner, Mr. Philip Brown. Tragically, her death was ruled a poisoning, and Mr. Brown was arrested shortly afterward. Though he denied involvement, he coerced my uncles (my mother\u2019s brothers) into signing agreements that excluded me from her company. I was later removed entirely for opposing their legal counsel, who I suspect colluded in her death.  \n\nRecently, while reviewing her financial records, I discovered a dormant account at First Continental Trust Bank (UK) containing $9,800,000. Per her deposit agreement, these funds were earmarked to purchase machinery for a new subsidiary. However, the bank cannot release the money without proof of a valid \u201ccustomer account\u201d linked to the intended machinery supplier.  \n\nThe Situation:  \nMy relatives have disowned me, seized her property, and threatened my safety. I cannot approach the bank directly, as they believe my mother is still alive (I claimed she is hospitalized to maintain her authority). To access the funds, I urgently need:  \n\n1. A Corporate Bank Account: You would act as the overseas supplier, allowing the bank to transfer the $9.8 million into an account under your name or business.  \n2. Relocation Support: Assistance arranging safe passage from Lagos to your country once the transfer is complete.  \n3. Compensation: You will retain 15% of the total amount ($1,470,000) for your partnership.  \n\nWhy Trust Me?  \nI am my mother\u2019s only child (born when she was 18), and my father abandoned us before my birth. At 20, I have no family, resources, or legal recourse here. Attached are redacted copies of the bank agreement and my mother\u2019s death certificate for verification.  \n\nThis request is confidential. If you are willing to help, please reply to joy.kem.assist@gmail.com or call +44 77 5348 1921 by October 15th. I will provide full documentation and coordinate next steps promptly.  \n\nThank you for considering this appeal. Your discretion and compassion could save my life and honor my mother\u2019s legacy.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMiss Joy Kem  \n(On behalf of the Kem Estate)  \n\n---  \nNote: All documentation will be verified through a trusted third-party legal advisor to ensure mutual security.

These funds remain held by a private security firm overseas. Due to my restricted movement and monitored communications, I require a trustworthy partner to facilitate the transfer.  \n\nMy legal representative, Barrister James Broderick (based in the UK), will coordinate the process.

My name is Mrs. Jewel Taylor, wife of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. As you may be aware, my husband has resided in Nigeria under political asylum since 2003, following the instability in Liberia. Recent developments by the United Nations and current Liberian authorities have necessitated his potential repatriation for judicial proceedings.  \n\nDue to heightened scrutiny, certain financial assets linked to my family have been restricted by the interim government. Among these is a trust holding $30,270,000.00 (thirty million two hundred and seventy thousand US dollars), originally designated for humanitarian projects. This account is now at risk of seizure, despite its legitimate origins.  \n\nGiven these circumstances, I seek your discretion to act as an intermediary to safeguard these funds. The process would involve transferring the amount temporarily to a secure offshore account under your name, after which my legal team will reclaim it through diplomatic channels. For your assistance, you will retain 20% of the total sum as compensation.  \n\nAll transactions will adhere to international compliance standards, and my family\u2019s legal advisors will oversee every step to ensure legality. Due to confidentiality concerns, I kindly request you reply directly to my private email: jeandcine@yahoo.co.uk, or contact me via secure line at +231 88 654 3219 (Monrovia).  \n\nTime is of the essence, as the government intends to finalize asset forfeiture within 10 business days. Your discretion in this sensitive matter is deeply valued.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Jewel Taylor  \nSpouse of H.E.

I write to you under strict confidentiality to propose a mutually beneficial arrangement regarding an unclaimed account in our records.  \n\nIn 2000, Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska, perished alongside his family in the tragic Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash (January 31, 2000). Documentation confirming this event is publicly available via the [CNN Archives](http://edition.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.crash/). Mr. Thompson maintained a dormant account (No. 14-2558-5976) with a balance of USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  \n\nPer Burkina Faso banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after four years. Despite repeated efforts to locate next-of-kin, no claimants have surfaced. As a foreign national, Mr. Thompson\u2019s account requires a non-Burkinab\u00e9 beneficiary to avoid forfeiture.  \n\nProposed Resolution:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next-of-kin to facilitate the transfer.  \n2. I will furnish verified documentation to legitimize your claim.  \n3. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% (USD 3,750,000.00) to you.  \n   - 5% allocated for administrative fees (taxes, legal, and transfer costs).  \n   - 65% retained by myself to secure internal approvals.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with BOA\u2019s internal protocols.

My name is Michael Kamah, the surviving son of the late Smith Kamah, a prominent diamond and gold trader from Beitbridge, Zimbabwe. I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, seeking your discreet assistance in resolving a critical family matter.  \n\nIn February 2002, my father and elder brother were killed during Zimbabwe\u2019s political upheaval while sheltering white farmers targeted by the government. Following their deaths, my mother, younger sister, and I fled to South Africa. The current regime has since frozen all family assets, including bank accounts and properties, due to my father\u2019s opposition to their policies.  \n\nBefore his passing, my father secured $7,400,000.00 USD in a sealed trunk box with Lom\u00e9 Secure Holdings, a licensed finance and security company in Togo. These funds were earmarked for a gold and diamond trade partnership, but he could not finalize the transaction. As the sole surviving heir, I must relocate these funds discreetly to safeguard my family\u2019s future.  \n\nI require a trustworthy partner abroad to act as the legal beneficiary of the trunk box. Your role would involve liaising with the security company to transfer the funds to a secure account in your name. I will cover all associated fees and guarantee a 20% compensation for your assistance. This transaction is fully legal and backed by documentation, though confidentiality is paramount to avoid interference from Zimbabwean authorities.  \n\nIf you are willing to assist, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \nPhone: +27 63 558 9012  \nEmail: michael.kamah.assist@gmail.com  \n\nDue to the sensitive nature of this request, I ask that you treat it with utmost discretion.

My name is Martin Chime, and I serve as a senior account manager at this branch. Your contact was discreetly recommended by a trusted intermediary within the Lagos Chamber of Commerce due to your international residency status, which aligns with the requirements of this matter.  \n\nBackground:  \nIn 2019, a foreign national, Mr. Kemal Aydin (a Turkish contractor residing in Lagos), maintained an account at our branch with a balance of USD 21.5 million. Mr. Aydin tragically passed away in a road accident later that year, and no next of kin or legal beneficiaries have come forward to claim these funds in the intervening four years. Under Nigerian banking regulations, dormant accounts of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the government if unclaimed.  \n\nProposal:  \nAs a bank employee, I am ethically obligated to resolve such cases transparently. However, given the lack of claimants, my team (including two senior colleagues) has identified a lawful pathway to transfer these funds to a qualified beneficiary. We propose to formally designate you as Mr. Aydin\u2019s distant relative and executor of his estate. Your role would involve providing basic documentation (e.g., passport, proof of address) to validate this claim. All internal bank approvals and probate processes have been prearranged to ensure swift execution.  \n\nTerms:  \n- Timeline: 10 business days to finalize documentation and release funds.  \n- Compensation: 30% of the total amount (USD 6.45 million) for your participation.  \n- Confidentiality: Communication will occur exclusively via secure channels until completion.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, confirm your interest by replying to this email or contacting me directly at +234 809 755 4321 (WhatsApp/SMS) or mgb.inheritanceclaims@ubanigeria-lag.com.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

My name is Mrs. Maryam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away unexpectedly on June 8, 1998. I am reaching out under strict confidentiality to seek your assistance in securing a financial legacy left by my late husband.  \n\nPrior to his passing, General Abacha established a USD 25 million deposit with a licensed security firm in Accra, Ghana, designated solely for my family\u2019s welfare. Due to ongoing investigations by the Nigerian government and international entities\u2014spearheaded by Swiss lawyer Enrico Monfrini\u2014into my late husband\u2019s estate, we have been unable to access these funds directly. As reported by The Guardian on March 15, 2000, significant assets linked to our family have been frozen or seized, leaving this deposit as our last recourse.  \n\nOur family attorney, Barrister Tony Musa, has safeguarded my husband\u2019s final will, which authorizes the release of these funds to a designated foreign trustee. Due to travel restrictions imposed on our family and heightened scrutiny of our associates, we require a discreet third party to act as the beneficiary of record. Your role would involve facilitating the transfer of the funds to a secure offshore account under your name, after which the entirety of the sum would be redirected to our family\u2019s custody.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- The deposit is held at Ghana Trust Securities Ltd., with valid Certificates of Deposit and a Notarized Power of Attorney prepared for your review.  \n- Barrister Musa will meet you in Accra to finalize documentation and accompany you to the depository.  \n- For security, all correspondence must occur via his secure email: tony.musalaw@abachalawfirm.com.ng or phone: +233 55 712 3098 (Ghana office).  \n\nYour Commitment:  \n1. Reply promptly with your full contact details (phone/fax) to enable direct coordination.  \n2. Maintain absolute confidentiality to avoid jeopardizing the process.  \n3. Upon successful transfer, you will receive USD 1.2 million (5% of the total) as compensation.  \n\nThis request is time-sensitive, as the depository requires proof of beneficiary status within 21 days to avoid forfeiture. I emphasize that this transaction is lawful and has been structured by our legal team, including consultation with the late Johnnie Cochran, to ensure compliance with international regulations.  \n\nYour discretion and goodwill are paramount. Kindly confirm your willingness to assist by replying to Barrister Musa directly.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Maryam Abacha  \nOn behalf of the Abacha Family Estate  \n\n---  \nNote: This email simulates a real-world scam for training purposes.

My name is Victoria Karegaye, a 22-year-old from Kigali, Rwanda. I am writing to you under extraordinary circumstances and apologize for the sudden nature of this request.  \n\nMy late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the Managing Director of Royal Diamond Corporation in Kigali. Tragically, he and my mother were killed during the civil unrest in 2018, and our family\u2019s assets were seized or destroyed. Before his passing, he secured a deposit certificate valued at $4.2 million USD under my name at the Bank of Kigali (Ref: BK-DC-4892).  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to the funds. However, due to my current refugee status (UNHCR Case ID: RW-1129-45M), Rwandan monetary policy prohibits me from directly accessing the account. The Central Bank of Rwanda requires a foreign national to act as a trustee to finalize the transfer.  \n\nI have been advised by my legal representative, Mr. Jean-Claude Niyomugabo (Bar License: RBA-6631), to identify a trustworthy individual abroad to facilitate this process. Your contact was recommended through a private directory, and I humbly ask if you would consider assisting me.  \n\nUpon your agreement:  \n1. I will provide notarized documents confirming my identity, the deposit certificate, and legal affidavits.  \n2. The Bank of Kigali will coordinate directly with you to process the transfer.  \n3. You will retain 15% of the total sum ($630,000 USD) as compensation.  \n\nTime is critical, as the bank will revoke the claim if unresolved within 14 business days. Please reply to v.karegaye.assist@zohomail.rw or call +250 7912 34891 (WhatsApp/Signal) at your earliest convenience.  \n\nThank you for your understanding. I remain hopeful for your kind response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nVictoria Karegaye  \nKigali, Rwanda  \n\nP.S. Strict confidentiality is requested, as my safety remains precarious.

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I write to you under strict confidentiality regarding a sensitive financial matter requiring urgent cooperation.  \n\nFollowing the passing of former Head of State General Sani Abacha on June 8, 1998, a routine customs inspection uncovered six diplomatic trunks aboard a chartered flight bound for Saudi Arabia. These trunks contained foreign currency totaling $197,570,000.00 USD. Per protocol, five trunks were declared to the government, while one containing $30,000,000.00 USD was discreetly secured to avoid public scrutiny during ongoing investigations into misappropriated state funds.  \n\nAs reported by The Guardian (July 2, 1999) and The London Times (July 12, 1998), international audits revealed billions linked to Abacha\u2019s associates. To mitigate risks, the remaining trunk was deposited with a licensed security firm under the classification \u201cPrecious Stones & Jewelry\u201d to obscure its contents. With recent legal clarity, my two trusted colleagues and I now seek to transfer this asset abroad via diplomatic channels, a process requiring third-party collaboration.  \n\nDue to Nigerian Civil Service regulations prohibiting foreign account ownership, we require your assistance to receive and safeguard these funds internationally. The proposed process is as follows:  \n1. The security firm\u2019s affiliate in London will dispatch the consignment as \u201cpersonal valuables\u201d under your name.  \n2. Upon arrival, you will retrieve the trunk and deposit the funds into a secure account.  \n3. Gradual remittances to Nigeria will be coordinated, with 20% of the total ($6,000,000.00 USD) allocated as your compensation.  \n\nThis transaction is legally protected under diplomatic immunity and poses no risk to you. Strict confidentiality is imperative.  \n\nContact Details for Further Discussion:  \n- Email: ben.suleman@fedcustoms.gov.ng  \n- Direct Line: +234 809 558 1234  \n- Office Address: Nigerian Customs Service, Cargo Wing, MMIA, Lagos.  \n\nKindly confirm your willingness to proceed via email at your earliest convenience.

I am contacting you with a time-sensitive opportunity that requires your immediate attention and utmost discretion.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Henry Whitaker, tragically passed away in a plane crash alongside his immediate family. Following standard protocol, our institution has held his dormant account containing USD $10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) while awaiting claims from a verified next of kin. Regrettably, all documented relatives perished in the same incident, and no legitimate claimant has come forward in over two decades.  \n\nPer ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to the national treasury after a five-year period. However, due to Mr. Whitaker\u2019s status as a foreign national, Burkina Faso law prohibits local citizens from acting as next of kin for international accounts. To resolve this matter, I propose a confidential partnership wherein you would be formally recognized as the beneficiary to facilitate the fund\u2019s release.  \n\nTerms of Collaboration:  \n1. Your Role: Provide a non-Burkinabe bank account to receive the funds.  \n2. Distribution:  \n   - 30% to you (as the designated beneficiary).  \n   - 10% allocated for administrative and legal fees.  \n   - 60% retained by my office for fiduciary management.  \n3. Process:  \n   - Submit a brief application to ADB, attesting to your relation to the deceased (template attached).  \n   - Provide your full banking details (account name, number, SWIFT/BIC) and contact information.  \n\nAll documentation will be processed under strict confidentiality. Upon approval, I will personally oversee the transfer and arrange to meet in your country for final disbursement.  \n\nRequired Details for Application:  \n- Full Name & Nationality  \n- Bank Name, Account Number, and SWIFT/BIC Code  \n- Contact Telephone/Fax Number  \n\nContact Information:  \n- Email: ibrahim.mussa@adb-bf.org  \n- Office Line: +226 25 44 58 90 (Mon\u2013Fri, 8:00 AM\u20134:00 PM GMT)  \n\nThis proposal is time-bound, as the ADB treasury audit cycle concludes on [Date: 30 days from current date]. Immediate action is advised to secure the funds before reclassification.  \n\nI assure you this transaction adheres to all legal protocols and guarantees mutual benefit. Your prompt response is appreciated.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nIbrahim Mussa  \nBill and Exchange Manager  \nAfrican Development Bank (ADB), Ouagadougou  \n\n---  \nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the recipient.

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction.

My name is Mariam Abacha, widow of General Sani Abacha, the former Head of State of Nigeria, who passed away in 1998. I obtained your contact details through a trusted associate affiliated with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who recommended you as a reputable professional capable of handling sensitive international transactions.  \n\nFollowing my husband\u2019s demise, the current administration has subjected me to relentless scrutiny and harassment, including freezing family assets and restricting my movements. While media reports claim the recovery of $700 million linked to my late husband\u2019s accounts abroad, these allegations are exaggerated and politically motivated. To secure my future, I discreetly transferred $35 million USD to a private security firm in Europe (identity disclosed upon your agreement). Due to my house arrest, I cannot access these funds directly.  \n\nI seek your assistance to receive this amount into a secure bank account under your name.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me.

My name is Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of a reputable financial institution in Kumasi, Ghana. I am reaching out to you in strict confidence to propose a legitimate collaboration that could yield significant mutual benefit.  \n\nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts, I identified an escrow account holding $12.5 million (USD). This account, opened in 1999, has remained inactive since 2000. Upon further investigation, I confirmed it belongs to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and Alaska resident who tragically perished with his family in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records corroborate this event (see [CNN Archives](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list) and [Thompson\u2019s biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html)).  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account\u2019s documentation, I confirmed no beneficiaries or next-of-kin claims exist. Per Ghanaian banking regulations, dormant accounts without claimants after 10 years may be transferred to the state. However, as Branch Manager, I retain discretionary authority to expedite the release of funds to a verified foreign next-of-kin.  \n\nProposed Collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Mr. Thompson\u2019s designated foreign beneficiary.  \n2. I will furnish all necessary legal and financial documentation to validate your claim.  \n3. Funds will be securely transferred to your nominated account.  \n\nThis process is fully compliant with institutional protocols, ensuring zero legal exposure. Upon successful transfer, I propose a 60-40% split in your favor, though terms are negotiable.  \n\nContact Details:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Mobile)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n- Email: godwin.akwesi@kumasi-bank.com.gh  \n\nTime sensitivity is critical, as internal audits occur quarterly. Kindly respond urgently to proceed.

Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa.

My name is Joseph Cabutti, and I serve as an independent auditing consultant for a prominent financial institution in Nigeria. I am writing to propose a confidential collaboration regarding an unclaimed estate requiring urgent intervention.  \n\nBackground:  \nDuring a routine audit in 2022, I discovered an inactive account held by a deceased client, Mr. Alain Mercier, a French industrialist and long-term customer of the bank. Mr. Mercier tragically perished in the Concorde Flight AF4590 crash on July 25, 2000, alongside all passengers. The account, opened in 1998 with a balance of $36,000,000.00 (USD), remains dormant as no legal will or designated beneficiary was identified.  \n\nExtensive efforts to locate Mr. Mercier\u2019s next of kin\u2014including coordination with French authorities and private investigators\u2014have been unsuccessful. Per Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets are transferred to federal reserves after 25 years. In this case, the bank\u2019s board has expedited proceedings to reclassify the funds by Q1 2024, with intentions to allocate them to government-administered trust funds.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the forfeiture of these funds, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal beneficiary via probate documentation, prepared by my associate attorney, Mr. Kwame Asante (Esq.).  \n2. The bank will authorize an initial transfer of $10,000,000.00 (USD) to your nominated account.  \n3. Upon successful completion, the remaining balance will follow within 7\u20139 business days.  \n\nTerms of Agreement:  \n- 65% of the total sum allocated to my team.  \n- 20% retained by you as beneficiary.  \n- 10% donated to humanitarian initiatives (mutually agreed upon).  \n- 5% reserved for administrative expenses (legal fees, bank charges).  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- A valid government-issued ID (scanned copy).  \n- Your private contact number and secure email for documentation review.  \n- Confirmation of a non-resident bank account (non-Nigerian) for fund remittance.  \n\nAll processes adhere to legal protocols, including a validated court order (Ref: FHC/ABJ/CS/891/2023) and notarized affidavits. Strict confidentiality is assured.  \n\nPlease reply urgently to secure this opportunity.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJoseph Cabutti  \nConsulting Auditor  \nBNP Legal & Financial Consulting Group  \nTel: +234 802 555 0193 | Email: jcabutti.consulting@bnplgrp.com  \n\nThis communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

My name is Victoria Karegaye, and I am writing to seek your assistance with a sensitive financial matter. I apologize for reaching out unexpectedly, but circumstances have left me with limited options.  \n\nI am a 22-year-old Rwandan national, and my late father, Dr. Michael Kagame Karegaye, was the managing director of Royal Diamond Company in Kigali. Tragically, both my parents lost their lives during the civil unrest in Rwanda several years ago. Before his passing, my father secured a deposit certificate at a reputable international bank in my name, valued at $2.75 million USD.  \n\nAfter years of legal proceedings, the bank has approved my claim to these funds. However, due to my current refugee status and strict international banking regulations (specifically AML/KYC policies for displaced persons), I am prohibited from opening an account to access the deposit. The bank has advised me to appoint a trusted representative abroad to facilitate the transfer on my behalf.  \n\nThis is where I humbly ask for your help. If you are willing to act as my intermediary, I will provide all necessary legal documents, including the deposit certificate, death certificates, and court affidavits. In return, you would retain 20% of the total amount as compensation for your assistance.  \n\nPlease note:  \n- The bank has confirmed this transaction complies with anti-money laundering laws, provided proper documentation is submitted.  \n- All communication will remain confidential.  \n- I can be reached at victoria.karegaye@yahoo.com or +250 78 345 6721 (WhatsApp) to discuss next steps.  \n\nI understand this request is unconventional, but I assure you it is legitimate. Should you require verification, the bank\u2019s compliance officer, Mr. Daniel M\u00fcller, can confirm the details at dmuller@globaltrustbank.co.rw (Tel: +250 78 512 3094).  \n\nI look forward to your response.  \n\nKind regards,  \nVictoria Karegaye  \nKigali, Rwanda",

My name is Alondra Jose-Carlos, and I am reaching out to you based on your professional background in [Recipient\u2019s Industry/Role, e.g., nonprofit leadership, community development]. I apologize for contacting you without prior introduction, but time constraints compel me to act swiftly.  \n\nI am a Puerto Rico resident currently undergoing treatment for stage IV metastatic cancer. My late husband, Dr. Kevin Jose-Carlos (1960\u20132002), was involved in arms distribution in conflict zones during his lifetime. While I did not participate in his activities, I inherited \u00a311.8 million from a fiduciary account he established with Harrington Trust Group UK prior to his passing. With my prognosis limiting my time, I seek to allocate these funds to organizations or individuals dedicated to humanitarian causes: war victim rehabilitation, environmental conservation, and orphanage support.  \n\nKey Details:  \n- Funds: \u00a311,800,000 held in escrow by Harrington Trust Group (Ref: HJG-2289-L4).  \n- Purpose: Full disbursement within 90 days to verified charities or vetted partners.  \n- Legality: The funds were cleared by UK probate courts in 2003, with no outstanding claims.  \n\nDue to my mobility limitations (partial paralysis), I require a trustee to liaise with the fiduciary firm and oversee allocations. Your profile suggests alignment with these goals, but I must stress confidentiality due to sensitivities around my husband\u2019s history.  \n\nIf willing to discuss further, please reply to alondra.jc@mail-service.com or call +1-787-555-0198 (9:00 AM\u20134:00 PM AST). I will provide legal documentation and trustee protocols upon your confirmation.  \n\nSincerely,  \nMrs. Alondra Jose-Carlos  \nPuerto Rico, USA  \n\u201cNo legacy is richer than integrity.\u201d  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

I am the widow of Daniel Somba, who served as a diplomatic attach\u00e9 at the Indian Embassy in Ivory Coast until his untimely passing in 2001 after a brief illness. We were married for eleven years but were not blessed with children.  \n\nFollowing my husband\u2019s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my faith. Before his passing, Daniel entrusted $5.5 million USD to a private security depository here in Abidjan to secure our family\u2019s future. Regrettably, my health has deteriorated in recent years. I have been diagnosed with terminal cancer and have also suffered multiple strokes, leaving me unable to manage this matter personally.  \n\nWith no immediate family to inherit these funds, I feel compelled by scripture (\u201cBlessed is the hand that gives\u201d) to direct this money toward charitable causes aligned with my faith. Specifically, I seek a trustworthy individual or organization to use the funds for orphanages, widows\u2019 support, and the maintenance of places of worship.  \n\nI have already provided the depository, Abidjan Secure Holdings, with legal documentation authorizing the release of these funds to a designated beneficiary. To proceed, please contact their transfer officer, Mr. Amadou Kouyat\u00e9, at +225 07 49 32 18 55 or askouyate@abjsecure.ci, referencing Case ID SHV-5543-09B.

I am contacting you in strict confidence regarding an unclaimed fixed deposit account held at our Lagos Main Branch.  \n\nAccount Details:  \n- Account Holder: Engr. Lee Seunghyo (Deceased)  \n- Deposit Amount: USD 25,000,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars)  \n- Deposit Tenure: 12-month fixed term (matured August 1998)  \n\nBackground:  \nEngr. Lee Seunghyo, a South Korean oil consultant contracted by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), opened this account in 1997. Regrettably, he perished in the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam on August 6, 1997. Following standard protocols, our bank issued notifications to his registered address upon the deposit\u2019s maturity. After receiving no response, we liaised with the NNPC, confirming his demise and the absence of a legally declared next of kin or will.  \n\nPer Nigerian banking regulations, unclaimed assets exceeding a 10-year dormancy period are subject to escheatment to the Federal Government. This account is now at risk of forfeiture, as no beneficiaries have come forward in 26 years.  \n\nProposal:  \nTo prevent the funds from being absorbed into government holdings, I propose a lawful collaboration:  \n1. You will be presented as Engr. Lee\u2019s designated beneficiary via probate documents.  \n2. Two licensed attorneys will draft and notarize the requisite affidavits and a retroactive will.  \n3. Funds will be transferred to a non-Nigerian account (mandated for USD repatriation).  \n\nRequired Information:  \nTo initiate documentation, kindly provide:  \n1. Full Legal Name & Residential Address  \n2. Date of Birth  \n3.

A provisional Order of Mandamus has been secured to fast-track beneficiary claims, but we must act before the Q3 2024 regulatory audit.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nReply to this email to confirm your interest. I will then forward attorney contact details and a secure portal link to submit your information. All communications remain confidential under Section 12(d) of the Nigerian Banking Secrecy Act.  \n\nShould you decline, kindly notify me promptly so I may pursue alternate candidates.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nDonald Ofu Obidima  \nSenior Credit Control Manager  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria  \nPhone: +234 809 755 4301  \nEmail: donald.obidima@uniontrustbank-ng.com  \nUnion Trust Bank of Nigeria is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) | RC 41981  \n\n---  \nThis email and attachments are privileged and confidential.

My name is Mrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye, widow of the late Mr. Issac Nuhan Vaye, who served as Deputy Minister of Public Works in Liberia until his untimely death in 2003. I am writing to you under deeply sensitive circumstances, seeking your discretion and assistance.  \n\nAs you may be aware from international media coverage (e.g., BBC, CNN), Liberia endured significant political instability during the presidency of Charles Taylor. My husband was wrongfully accused of conspiring against Taylor\u2019s regime and executed without trial. Before his death, he discreetly secured $21.5 million USD through diplomatic channels, originally intended for agricultural infrastructure projects. These funds remain held by a private security logistics firm in Europe, awaiting legitimate transfer to a trustworthy partner.  \n\nDue to my restricted mobility (I am confined to our family estate under government surveillance) and monitored communications, I cannot act directly. My legal representative, Barrister James Broderick (based in London, UK), will facilitate the process. He will furnish you with documentation to verify this matter, including proof of deposit and my husband\u2019s political records.  \n\nProposed Arrangement:  \n1. Barrister Broderick will coordinate with the security firm to transfer the funds to a designated account under your name.  \n2. For your assistance, 20% ($4.3 million USD) will be allocated to you, with the remainder reserved for relocating my family and reinvesting in Liberia\u2019s agricultural sector.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nPlease contact Barrister Broderick directly via the details below to initiate proceedings. He will require your:  \n- Full name  \n- Residential/company address  \n- Private telephone and fax numbers (for secure communication)  \n\nContact Information:  \nName: Barrister James Broderick, Esq.  \nTel: +44 7040 120730  \nFax: +44 870 1348903  \nEmail: brr.jmsbroderick@kaixo.com | james.broderick@yahoo.com.hk  \n\nThis transaction is legally structured to comply with international financial regulations. However, confidentiality is critical given Liberia\u2019s fragile political climate. I implore you to treat this matter with urgency and discretion.  \n\nShould you require independent verification, I encourage you to reference historical reports on my husband\u2019s case via reputable outlets such as The Guardian or Reuters (search terms: \u201cIsaac Nuhan Vaye,\u201d \u201cLiberia 2003 coup allegations\u201d).  \n\nI respectfully request your prompt response.  \n\nYours sincerely,  \nMrs. Suzana Nuhan Vaye  \nMonrovia, Liberia",

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer.

This communication pertains to an urgent financial matter requiring your immediate attention.  \n\nIn 2001, a foreign client of ours, Mr. Gerald H. Bracken (deceased), held an account with a balance of USD 10,500,000.00 (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Tragically, Mr. Bracken and his immediate family perished in a plane crash in November of that year. Despite exhaustive efforts to locate next of kin, no legal claimants have come forward. Per ADB regulations, unclaimed assets are designated for transfer to the national treasury after a 5-year dormancy period. However, due to Mr. Bracken\u2019s foreign nationality, Burkinab\u00e9 law prohibits local citizens from acting as claimants, necessitating international collaboration.  \n\nTo resolve this matter, I propose the following:  \n1. You will be designated as the legal next of kin to facilitate the transfer of funds into a secure offshore account under your name.  \n2. Funds will be disbursed as follows:  \n   - 30% to you (as the foreign partner).  \n   - 60% retained by myself (for administrative oversight).  \n   - 10% allocated for transaction-related expenses (legal fees, banking charges).  \n\nRequired Action:  \n- Provide your full banking details (bank name, account number, SWIFT/BIC code).  \n- Confirm a direct contact number and email for documentation.  \n\nUpon receipt of your details, I will forward a notarized affidavit of kinship and transfer authorization forms via encrypted email. Rest assured, this process adheres strictly to ADB protocols, and all documentation will be validated by our legal team to ensure compliance.  \n\nGiven the sensitive nature of this transaction, I urge discretion and prompt action to prevent forfeiture of these funds.

My name is Mrs. Comfort Somba, a widow residing in Chennai, India. My late husband, Mr. Daniel Somba, served as a senior diplomat at the Indian Embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for nine years until his untimely passing in 2001 due to complications from pneumonia. We were married for 11 years but had no children.  \n\nFollowing Daniel\u2019s death, I chose to honor our union by remaining unmarried and childless, in accordance with my Christian faith. During his tenure abroad, my husband prudently secured a savings deposit of $5.5 million USD (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with Abidjan Secure Holdings Ltd., a licensed private security vaulting firm in Ivory Coast.  \n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer and have suffered recurring complications from a stroke, leaving me physically weakened. Given my prognosis, I seek a compassionate, God-fearing individual or organization to steward these funds in alignment with biblical principles. Per my late husband\u2019s wishes, the funds must be used to:  \n1. Support orphanages and widows in underserved communities.  \n2. Maintain places of worship and fund evangelistic missions.  \n3. Distribute Bibles and educational resources to impoverished regions.  \n\nAll legal documentation, including a notarized Letter of Authority and my husband\u2019s deposit certificates, has been prearranged with Abidjan Secure Holdings. Upon your confirmation, their transfer department will validate your identity and initiate the release process. I have attached a reference case number (ASHL-1149/CS) for expedited handling.  \n\nTo proceed, kindly contact Mr. Amara Diallo, Senior Client Relations Officer, directly via:  \n- Email: client.services@abidjansecureholdings.ci  \n- Telephone: +225 07 85 23 41 09 (WhatsApp available)  \n\nPlease provide your full name, contact details, and a brief explanation of how you intend to fulfill this mission. Time is of the essence, as my medical team anticipates further decline in my condition.  \n\nMay God guide your heart to act wisely.  \n\nYours in faith,  \nMrs. Comfort Somba  \n(Attachments: Deposit Certificate Copy, Medical Summary, Letter of Authorization)  \n\n---  \nNote: This email is formatted for realism.

This letter must come to you\nas a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and\nbecome great friends and business partners.\nMy name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in\nGhana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust\nyou with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me.

My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, and I serve as the Branch Manager of Kumasi Commercial Bank in Ghana. I am writing to you in strict confidence regarding a time-sensitive financial matter that requires your cooperation.  \n\n### Background of the Proposal  \nDuring a routine audit of dormant accounts at our branch, I discovered an escrow account holding USD 12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This account has remained inactive for nearly five years and is registered under the name of Mr. Morris Thompson, an American industrialist and resident of Alaska.  \n\nRegrettably, Mr. Thompson and his family perished in the Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crash on January 31, 2000. Public records confirm this tragedy, which you may verify through reputable sources such as:  \n- [CNN Archives: Alaska Airlines Crash Report](http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska-airlines-list)  \n- [Morris Thompson\u2019s Biography](http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mthompson)  \n\nAs the sole custodian of this account, I confirmed that no beneficiaries or next-of-kin were ever designated. Under Ghanaian banking regulations, unclaimed assets of this nature are subject to eventual forfeiture to the state.  \n\n### Request for Collaboration  \nTo lawfully transfer these funds, I require a foreign partner to act as the legal next-of-kin to Mr. Thompson. As Branch Manager, I am positioned to authorize the release of the funds once credible documentation is submitted. Your role would involve:  \n1. Providing a valid international passport for identity verification.  \n2. Signing affidavits (prepared by my legal team) to establish your claim.  \n3. Receiving the funds into your designated account, after which we would share the proceeds.  \n\n### Proposed Terms  \n- 60% of the total amount to you (USD 7,500,000.00).  \n- 40% retained by me to cover administrative and legal expenses.  \n\nThis transaction is fully compliant with my bank\u2019s internal protocols, and I assure you of its legitimacy. Strict confidentiality is imperative to avoid external interference.  \n\n### Next Steps  \nIf agreeable, kindly reply to this email or contact me directly at:  \n- Phone: +233 20 821 6645 (Office Hours: 8:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PM GMT)  \n- Fax: +233 27 621 073  \n\nI urge discretion and prompt action to secure this opportunity.  \n\nRespectfully,  \nMr. Godwin Akwesi  \nBranch Manager  \nKumasi Commercial Bank  \nAddress: PMB 245, Adum, Kumasi, Ghana  \n\nNote: This communication is privileged and intended solely for the addressee.

I am writing to you under urgent and sensitive circumstances, seeking your partnership to secure a family legacy.  \n\nPrior to his assassination by agents of the current regime, my father discreetly safeguarded USD $10,000,000 in the form of gemstones within a sealed metal trunk.

Before his death we were married for 11 good years without a\nchild and were both born again Christians . Since his death I decided\nnot to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible forbids. \n \nWhen my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million \nTen Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars with A Bank.\nPresently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the\nRESERVE FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not\nlast for the next Three3 months due to my cancer problems. \n\nThough what disturbs me most now, i recently had stroke.Having known \nmy condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or betterstill a \nChristian or muslim individual That will utilize this money theway I am \ngoing to instruct here in. I want a church that will use thisfund on, \norphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God \nand to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to \nunderstand that blessed is the hand that giveth.\nI took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit \nthis money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want \nmy husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont \nwant a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. \nHence the reason for taking this bold decision. \n \nAs soon as I receive your reply I will forward your personal \ninformation, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your \ntelephone and fax number to my lawyer through his email  so that he \nwill contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be \ntransferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your \ncountry. \nI will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as \nthe real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want \nyou and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my \nshepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund \nwhen it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a \nlife of a worthy Christian. \n\nWhoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and \ntruth. Please always be\nprayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me \nroom in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same \npurpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated \nherein.Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.\n  \nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord. \nYours in Christ, \n\nMrs. Christina Holden.",

My name is Christina Holden, widow of Dr. Donald Holden, a Canadian geologist who worked with Shell Oil in Calgary until his passing in 2019 after a sudden cardiac event. During our 11-year marriage, we remained childless but committed to our faith as active members of Trinity Baptist Church in Vancouver.  \n\nFollowing Donald\u2019s death, I relocated to Ottawa to manage his estate, which includes a $10.5 million trust fund held with Reserve Finance & Trust (Toronto branch), established through his lifetime savings. Recently, I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic cancer at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital. My prognosis is limited, compounded by a mild stroke last month that has left me with limited mobility.  \n\nGiven my circumstances, I seek to transfer this fund to a reputable religious organization to fulfill our shared commitment to supporting orphanages, medical care for the disabled, and widows in underserved communities. My husband\u2019s family, while kind, does not share our faith, and I cannot risk the funds being diverted from their intended purpose.  \n\nTo proceed, I require your official church documentation (registration details, mission statement, and recent charitable project summaries) to forward to my estate lawyer, Mr. James Miller (james.miller@holdenlegal.ca | +1-613-555-0198), who will draft the transfer paperwork. Strict confidentiality is essential to avoid external interference.  \n\nUpon verification, the funds will be released to your church\u2019s designated account within 7\u201310 business days. I humbly ask for your prayers during this time and assurance that the funds will be managed per 1 Timothy 6:18\u201319. Kindly respond by August 25th to ensure timely processing.  \n\nMay God bless your ministry.  \n\nSincerely in Christ,  \nChristina Holden  \n34 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa, ON K1P 1C7  \nchristina.holden1948@outlook.com | +1-613-555-0126  \n\nNote: All correspondence must be copied to Mr. Miller for legal oversight.",

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

My name is Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, and I am writing to you with a heartfelt appeal for assistance in fulfilling a final humanitarian endeavor.  \n\nI am a Dubai-based oil merchant currently undergoing treatment for late-stage cancer. My prognosis, as confirmed by my medical team at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, leaves me with limited time. While I have allocated most of my assets to family, recent events have compelled me to seek an external partner to ensure a portion of my wealth reaches those truly in need.  \n\nSpecifically, I seek your help in disbursing $35 million USD held in a secured vault at Al-Madina Trust Vault Services (Dubai) since 2003. These funds were earmarked for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. Regrettably, my deteriorating health prevents me from overseeing this personally, and past reliance on family for similar tasks proved disappointing.  \n\nHow You Can Assist:  \n1. Authorization: I will formally designate you as my representative to retrieve the funds.  \n2. Disbursement: 90% ($31.5M) will be distributed to vetted NGOs, including CARE International and the Red Crescent Society.  \n3. Compensation: 10% ($3.5M) will be transferred to you for your time and administrative efforts.  \n\nNext Steps:  \nTo proceed, kindly provide:  \n- Full legal name and current residential address  \n- Mobile/office contact number (e.g., +971-12-523-5672)  \n- Occupation and professional background (for due diligence)  \n\nUpon confirmation, my legal advisor, Mr. Karim Al-Farsi (+971-55-632-1890 / k.al-farsi@almadinatrust.ae), will coordinate with you to initiate the process.  \n\nI understand this request may seem unconventional, but I assure you it is made in good faith. Should you have reservations, I welcome a brief call to address concerns. Time is of the essence, and your discretion is appreciated.  \n\nMay kindness guide your decision.  \n\nKind regards,  \nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf  \nDubai, UAE  \n(Direct correspondence: zarqawi.yusuf@outlook.ae)  \n\n---  \nNote: This request is confidential.

Please review the following critical reminders to ensure compliance and vigilance:  \n\n1. \u201cWhen 900 years old you reach, look as good, you will not.\u201d \u2013 Yoda  \n   Translation: Long-term security requires proactive adaptation. Fraud tactics evolve constantly; outdated verification methods (e.g., static passwords) may no longer suffice. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all systems by Friday, 25 October 2024.  \n\n2. \u201cWhen the outlook is poor, try the uplook.\u201d  \n   Application: If a transaction appears suspicious (e.g., mismatched vendor details, urgency to bypass protocols), escalate immediately to the Fraud Hotline (1-800-555-0199) or email fraud.report@safetyawareness.org. Do not proceed without secondary approval.  \n\n3. \u201cGod is dead. \u2013 Nietzsche / Nietzsche is dead. \u2013 God\u201d  \n   Context: Verify sources rigorously. Phishing attempts often impersonate leadership or trusted entities (e.g., \u201cCEO\u201d requesting urgent wire transfers). Confirm all high-risk requests via voice call using pre-registered contact details.  \n\n4. \u201cA professor is one who talks in someone else\u2019s sleep.\u201d  \n   Implication: Complacency enables fraud. Report anomalies even if they seem minor. For example, discrepancies in invoice amounts or sudden changes to payment instructions (e.g., new bank accounts) must trigger a review.  \n\nAction Required:  \n- Complete the 2024 Fraud Awareness Module by logging into the HR Portal (deadline: 31 October 2024).  \n- Forward suspicious emails directly to it.security@yourcompanydomain.com; do not click links or download attachments.  \n\nContact Support:  \n- IT Helpdesk: 1-888-555-0321 (24/7)  \n- Compliance Team: compliance.assist@safetyawareness.org  \n\nYour diligence ensures collective security. Failure to adhere to these protocols may result in disciplinary action.  \n\nBest regards,  \nLila Chen  \nHead of Fraud Prevention & Compliance  \nEnterprise Risk Management Division  \n\n---  \nThis email is automated.

Schmidt  \n\n[Article Image Caption: Jason Andrew for The New York Times]  \n\nFederal investigators have identified significant discrepancies in White House telephone logs from January 6, 2021, complicating the House Select Committee\u2019s investigation into former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s activities during the Capitol riot. The missing data has raised questions about the completeness of official records and the administration\u2019s adherence to federal documentation protocols.  \n\nThe House panel is working to determine whether critical communications involving Trump or senior aides were omitted from logs during the hours surrounding the attack. This development underscores challenges in reconstructing a detailed timeline of events, a key focus of the committee\u2019s final report.  \n\n---\n\nStay Informed with Breaking News Alerts  \nSign up for real-time updates on major global events, delivered directly to your inbox.  \n\n\u2705 Get Breaking News Emails  \n[Click here to subscribe](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/breaking)  \n\n---\n\nNeed Assistance?  \nVisit our [Help Center](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us) or contact Customer Care at 1-800-NYTIMES (1-800-698-4637).  \n\n---\n\nYou received this email as part of your New York Times subscription.  \nTo manage your preferences or unsubscribe, [click here](https://www.nytimes.com/mypreferences).  \n\nConnect With Us  \n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nytimes) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nytimes) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nytimes)  \n\nThe New York Times Company  \n620 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10018  \n[Privacy Policy](https://www.nytimes.com/privacy) | [California Notices](https://www.nytimes.com/california-notices)  \n\n---  \nThis is an automated message.
