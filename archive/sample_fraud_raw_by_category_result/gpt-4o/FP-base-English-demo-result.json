In an account that \nbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family \nin a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the \nwhole life of the pasengeres on board.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar\ntment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the \nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this \nmoney to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \ncolleagues.\n\nThereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\n\n   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text \nof the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. \nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\n  Yours faithfully,\n  MR.MASSAN AHMED\nBill and exchange manager\n  BANK OF AFRICA BOA.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode  envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \ntéléphone portable ! httpwww.msn.frhotmailimode",

        "raw_data": "Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South\nAfrica Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore\naccount hence your importance in the whole transaction.\n\nThis amount TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLAR $10.5m\nrepresents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my\nDepartment by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials\nover-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid\nto the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said\namount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic\nTransfer T.T to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an\napplication through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the\ntransfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.\n\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you be\nwilling to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your share\nof the sum will be 25% of the $10.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation\nand miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part\nprovided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your\narea of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of\nthis transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will\nnot disappoint me.\n\nEndeavor to contact me through above e-mail address or the fax number\nwhether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will\nenable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to\nassure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment\nof this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and\nguarantee that our share will be secured. And please remember to treat this\nas very confidential because, we will not comprehend with any form of\nexposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once\nagain that, time is of the essence in this business.\n\nI wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBONGIES ZULU\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet news headlines and download FREE stuff - visit MSN South Africa! \nhttpwww.msn.co.za",

        "raw_data": "Dear\n\nPlease let this letter not to bring confusion to you. I \nknow that we have not met either before but hear me from \nthe dept of your mind. It is circumstances that made to \nsend this to you.\n\nI will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a \nyear ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in \nbusiness. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he \nentered an agreement with my mothers brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mothers interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the companys lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the companys document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am \ncontacting you.\n\nI have been nick named bastard by my mothers relations, \nThey have named me all source of names even calling me \noutcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mothers mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement \nshe made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.\n\nPlease all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted \nto her companys costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I dont want the bank to know that my mother \nis late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.\n\n1.I want you to provide an account where the money will \nbe remitted into as my mothers costumer. 2.Make \narrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible\n3.How much commission you will take for rendering the \nassistant?\n\nMy mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only \nchild while she was having an affair with the person that \nsurpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the \nman abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to \nremain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father \nfor a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I \ndont have any one to run into. All the members of my \nmother family have turned their back on me because I \ndemand for me right. They told me that I dont belong to \nthe family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom \nI dont know. I have made trace to know my father without \nsucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your \nheart and accord me this help.\n\nGod will bless you for saving my life and future.\n\nBest wishes,\nMiss Joy Kem.",
