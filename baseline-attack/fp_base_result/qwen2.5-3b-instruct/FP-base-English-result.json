These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.¬†¬†The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors.¬†A word from the Recruiter¬†Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched,¬†our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions.¬†In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members,¬†once they do the first project they want more and more.¬†As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door.¬†Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like  I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here. ¬†Here, the¬†PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product,¬†including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from,¬†this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope.¬†The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.¬†This is what not shared on the JD.¬†How you will mature your career.¬†Job Responsibilities¬† For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

            "description": "Senior Engineering Product ManagerAs a member of the Service Provider Engineering team, you will be responsible for managing the development of broadband DSL products targeted at service providers that provide Home Gateway, voice gateways, wireless adapters, IPTV and Voice over IP VoIP services. These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.¬†¬†The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors.¬†A word from the Recruiter¬†Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched,¬†our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions.¬†In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members,¬†once they do the first project they want more and more.¬†As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door.¬†Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like  I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here. ¬†Here, the¬†PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product,¬†including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from,¬†this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope.¬†The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.¬†This is what not shared on the JD.¬†How you will mature your career.¬†Job Responsibilities¬† For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

        "raw_data": "Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

My search for a trustworthy individualfirm has led me to\nyou. I came across your contact while looking for a worthwhile investments\nor projects that I can be affiliated with. I am writing you this letter to\nask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.\n\nThe proposition\n\nAn industrialist and a foreigner who was customer of my client bank, who\ndied on the 25TH JULY, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH Flight AF4590 with\nthe whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing discovered\nan account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST who\ndied without a written or oral WILL attached to the account. Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa. In order to\navert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have you\nstand as a next of kin to late beneficiary so that the funds USD36m would\nbe released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. We\nwish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00Ten million and upon\nsuccessful transaction without any disappointment from your side we shall\nre-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.\n\nI have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom\nI must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which\nwould substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and\nsuccessful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are\ngoing to nominate. On this note, We have secured from the probate an order\nof mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiary and more so we are\nassuring you this business is 100% risk free involvement you should not\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized\nwithin 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary\nof the fund from the deceased. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of\nthe fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum,\n10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5%\nwill be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the\ntransfer process.\n\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you do not make undue advantage of the\ntrust we have bestowed on you, then kindly get to me immediately.\n\nPlease furnish me with your private Telephone and Fax Number for easy and\nsafe communication.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nJoseph Cabutti.",

In an account that \nbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family \nin a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the \nwhole life of the pasengeres on board.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \nsupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash \nleaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar\ntment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the \nmoney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and \nsubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this \nmoney to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin \nin this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my \ncolleagues.\n\nThereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement \naccoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate \ntrnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank \nas relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your \nbank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and \neffective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.\n\n   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text \nof the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. \nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\n  Yours faithfully,\n  MR.MASSAN AHMED\nBill and exchange manager\n  BANK OF AFRICA BOA.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail sur i-mode  envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre \nt√©l√©phone portable ! httpwww.msn.frhotmailimode",

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things. In case you dont accept please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.NO RISK IS INVOLVED AS IAM STILL IN CONTROL OF MY HUSBANDS AFFAIRS.

        "raw_data": "Good day,\n\n    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you\nconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our\nbanks management three years ago.\n\nI am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain\nfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the\nsubject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with\nour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial\nportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us\nturn over invest on his behalf.\n\nIn mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to\nmake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I\ninformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have\nthis done and in order not to circumvent due process.\n\nCash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the\nincidents of 911. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available\nto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I\nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds\ndeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist\nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and\nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake\ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly\nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and\nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was\ndeposited with the security firm.\n\nThe deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we\nhad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and\nwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of\nthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.\nI immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\ninvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\nperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in\nCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the\nbody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us\nmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a\nname depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful weve used our\nprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the\nproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with\nyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want\nyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\nworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those\nthat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should\nhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.\nThere is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I\nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one\nunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this\ndeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.\n\nMy proposal I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to\nthe deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you\nthe beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 Six Million United states\nDollar I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security\nFirm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon\nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 6040.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would\nhave drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the\ndeposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this\nproject that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be\nvindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete\nthis message and forget I ever contacted you.\n\n I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels I\nwill deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you\ncontacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you\ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through\nthe numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I\ndo not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are\nnot secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level\nof customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please\nobserve this instruction religiously.\n\nDo not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private\nemail davbryan00sify.com\n\nI await your response.\n\nDavid Bryan",

I decided to contact you after I went through my fathers file. \nHence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.\n\nMy name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy \nfarmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my \ncountry, Movement for Democratic Change MDC. Our wicked President Robert  \nmugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have \nbecome his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and \na moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of \nbrutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.\n\nHere is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  \ndeposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars US$10,000,000.00 with a \nsecurity company,The money was deposited as a gemprecious stone in a metal \ntrunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company \norganization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money. In view of this, The monetary policylaw does not allow such \ninvestment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can \nassist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.\n\n\nAs I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this\ninformation as top secret. Then u can also contact me through this \nalternative mail mr_desmond3yahoo.com.au\n\nYours Sincerely,\nMr.Desmond Martin.",

        "raw_data": "Dear Beloved in Christ,\n \nPlease bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it \nas I know we dont know each. Its my belief that I am doing the lords \nbidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the \ncourage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I \nwill need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and \nunbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I \ntrust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in \nmy heart.\n \n \nIt is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth I \nhad no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for \neternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and \nglory upon my life.\n \n \nI am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an \nexpatriate Contractor with ChevronTexaco in Kenya for twenty years before \nhe died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My \nHusband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before \nhis death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I \ndecided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the \nBible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the \nsum of US$7.5 Million Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars in \na 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, \nthis moneywith accrued interest is still with the Bank and the management \njust wrote me as the next of Kinbeneficiary to the account that it has \nbecome DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the \ncompletion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not \nre-activate the account the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a \nletter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my \nconditionnote that you need to activate this account as I can not come \nover. Presently, Im in a hospital in Kenya I chose to remain here since I \nwill die closer to nature and the lord where I have been undergoing \ntreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my \ndoctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last \nwish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the \nWorld that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth \nhere in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an \norphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  \nBecause relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my \nillness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this \nresponsibility to any one of them any more. \n \n \nI feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or \nyou are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open \nyour heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why \nwould a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and \nbe offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA \nexcept, that I know that the lords way are not our ways. I have come to \nconclude thats its divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by \nhis breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty \nof his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become \nvery clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you \nare chosen for this, you other than someone else. Its all part of the big \npicture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend \nforever............\n \n \nPlease, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary \nand collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who \nwill use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the \nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible \nmade us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this \ndecision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my \nhusbands relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking \nthis bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going \nto. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus14 VS14 \nsays that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not \ncommunicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice \nand presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them \nto know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my \nhusbands wealth and not my health.\n \n \nWith God all things are possible. \n \nYour Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Sandra White.",

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment.

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",

        "raw_data": "Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest heart attack while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody for safety the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husbands wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the Personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this SOS call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email tony_mlawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him my Attorney on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nI declared only 5 five boxes to the government and withheld one 1 in my custody containing the sum of US$30,000,000.00 Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\nto US$55 Billion Dollars refngrguardiannews.com of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one 1box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as Precious Stones and Jewellry in other that its\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \n\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\n\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \n\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\n\nExpecting your response urgently.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMr. Ben Suleman",

I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things.

Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to\ninfluence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the\naccount, which I shall give you.\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.\nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed\nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of\nlaw.\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to\nshare the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.\nContact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work\ntogether, so we can go over the details.\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.\nYou can as well contact me by phone the number is 233208216645.\nRegards,\nMr. Godwin Akwesi.",

My search for a trustworthy individualfirm has led me to\nyou. I came across your contact while looking for a worthwhile investments\nor projects that I can be affiliated with. I am writing you this letter to\nask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.\n\nThe proposition\n\nAn industrialist and a foreigner who was customer of my client bank, who\ndied on the 25TH JULY, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH Flight AF4590 with\nthe whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing discovered\nan account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST who\ndied without a written or oral WILL attached to the account. Since his\ndeath, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any\nrelative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one\nhas come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account\nor anything concerning it.\n\nThe account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of\nhis company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00\nUSD Thirty six million united states dollars which the bank now expects\na next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to\nget in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of\nthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin\nand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman\nand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement\nfor the funds to be declared UNCLAIMED and will be lost to the Federal\nGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and\nAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa. In order to\navert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have you\nstand as a next of kin to late beneficiary so that the funds USD36m would\nbe released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. We\nwish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00Ten million and upon\nsuccessful transaction without any disappointment from your side we shall\nre-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.\n\nI have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom\nI must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which\nwould substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and\nsuccessful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are\ngoing to nominate. On this note, We have secured from the probate an order\nof mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiary and more so we are\nassuring you this business is 100% risk free involvement you should not\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized\nwithin 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary\nof the fund from the deceased. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of\nthe fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum,\n10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5%\nwill be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the\ntransfer process.\n\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you do not make undue advantage of the\ntrust we have bestowed on you, then kindly get to me immediately.\n\nPlease furnish me with your private Telephone and Fax Number for easy and\nsafe communication.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nJoseph Cabutti.",

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which\ncrashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee\nSeunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next\nof kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin\nor relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit\npaperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the\nend of each year.\n\nSince the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the\naccount with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved\nabortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of\nUSD.$25million, Twenty five million United States Dollars which has\nbeen with my branch for a very long time.

I crave your indulgence as i contact you \nin such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter \ncarefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial \nrewards for both of us.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred \nThousand US dollars US$10.5m only , in an account that belongs to one of \nour foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 \nin a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the \ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt \nthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the \nplan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business \nproposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in \nthis business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that \n30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the \nprovision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred \nduring the business and 60% would be for me.\n\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this \nfund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or \nnext of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account \nnumber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective \ncommunication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt \nof your reply,\n\nI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not \nfail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that \nyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have \nbeen made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you \nreceive this letter.

This letter must come to you\nas a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and\nbecome great friends and business partners.\nMy name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in\nGhana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust\nyou with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have\na transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required\nas a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head\noffice, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our\nbranch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present\nManager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an\naccount with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated\non for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this\naccount belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in\nthe plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31\n2000, including his wife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation\nhttpwww.cnn.com2000US0201alaska.airlines.list and\nwww.nativefederation.orghistorypeoplemThompson.html\nThe account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank\nand no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,\nthe account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of\nthe account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money\nas next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is\naware of the account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and\nshare it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to\ninfluence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the\nnext of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the\naccount, which I shall give you.\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.\nThere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed\nunder a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of\nlaw.\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to\nshare the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.\nContact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work\ntogether, so we can go over the details.\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you.\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.\nYou can as well contact me by phone the number is 233208216645.\nRegards,\nMr. Godwin Akwesi.",

My father was a fighter for Justice and \na moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of \nbrutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.\n\nHere is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  \ndeposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars US$10,000,000.00 with a \nsecurity company,The money was deposited as a gemprecious stone in a metal \ntrunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company \norganization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and \nchemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and \nSwaziland.\n\nThe government seized my fathers farms and bank account before his Murder. \nHe told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This \nis why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, \nso that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment \nof the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your \nassistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the \ngovernment does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge \nsum of money. In view of this, The monetary policylaw does not allow such \ninvestment by an asylum seeker or refugee.

I have been diagnosed with Cancer,\nwhich was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.\nIt has defiled all forms of medicine Right now I have only about a\nlimited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly\nlived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil\nbusiness.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my\nbusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this\nas I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make\nall the money in the world.\n\nI believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for\nmy healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my\nimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.\ni want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have\ndecided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort\nto the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I\nwant this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by\ndistributed some of this money to some charity organizations in\nIndia,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self\nanymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in\nSaudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity\norganization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They\ncashed the money but kept it only to themselves.\n\nHence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows\nof, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars\n US$35Million  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as\nfamily valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect\nthis deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake\nvictims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate\nyour wiliness to assist in this disbursement.\n\n I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the\nsecurity company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with\nyour full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your\nOccupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible\nperson to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less\nprivileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only\nAllah heals.\n\n\nWasaalam\n\nRegards,\nAl-Zarqawi Yusuf.",
